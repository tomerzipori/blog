	abstract = {Stern, West, and Schmitt (2014) reported that liberals display truly false uniqueness in contrast to moderates and conservatives who display truly false consensus. We conducted a close, preregistered replication of Stern et al.’s (2014) research with a large sample (N = 1,005). Liberals, moderates, and conservatives demonstrated the truly false consensus effect by overestimating ingroup consensus. False consensus was strongest among conservatives, followed by moderates, and weakest among liberals. However, liberals did score higher than moderates and conservatives on the need for uniqueness scale, which partially accounted for the difference in false consensus between liberals and conservatives. Overall, our data align with Stern et al.’s (2014) in demonstrating left-right ideological differences in the overestimation of ingroup consensus but fall short of illustrating a liberal illusion of uniqueness.},

In Study 1, a nationally representative telephone survey, participants with a high dispositional need to belong perceived greater consensus for their opinions on immigrant naturalization than did those with a low need to belong. However, this relationship was strongest among participants who reported that the issue was personally important to them. In Study 2, participants primed with rejection-related (versus acceptance-related) words, and who reported high levels of issue importance, demonstrated greater false consensus for their opinions on a proposed alcohol tax increase. In Study 3, participants who received random feedback that they held a common (versus uncommon) opinion had a lower subsequent need to belong when the issue was important to them, suggesting that consensus perceptions can in fact mitigate belongingness needs.

In the present study, we looked at the effects of politicians’ subjective claims to public opinion on the evaluation of the politicians and on people’s percep­ tion of public opinion. In addition, we tested whether this communication strategy resonates especially well with people holding populist attitudes. In a 2 × 4 experiment, we were able to show that the use of subjective claims strongly shaped public opinion per­ ceptions but did not necessarily improve the evalua­ tion of the politician. The effects occurred regardless of people’s populist attitudes.},

	abstract = {For decades, social psychologists have collected data primarily from college undergraduates and, recently, from haphazard samples of adults. Yet researchers have routinely presumed that thus observed treatment effects characterize “people” in general. Tests of seven highly cited social psychological phenomena (two involving opinion change resulting from social influence and five involving the use of heuristics in social judgments) using data collected from randomly sampled, representative groups of American adults documented generalizability of the six phenomena that have been replicated previously with undergraduate samples. The 1 phenomenon (a cross-over interaction revealing an ease of retrieval effect) that has not been replicated successfully previously in undergraduate samples was also not observed here. However, the observed effect sizes for the replicated phenomena were notably smaller on average than the meta-analytic effect sizes documented by past studies of college students. Furthermore, the phenomena were strongest among participants with the demographic characteristics of the college students who typically provided data for past published studies, even after correcting for publication bias in past studies using a new method, called the behaviorally-informed file-drawer adjustment. The six successful replications suggest that phenomena identified in traditional laboratory research also appear as expected in representative samples but more weakly, so observed effect sizes should be generalized with caution. The evidence of demographic moderators suggests interesting opportunities for future research to better understand the mechanisms of the effects and their limiting conditions.},

This differential pattern of awareness has implications for {individualsÕ} assessment of collective preferences. This article extends recent research on motivated reasoning to test whether accuracy goals (i.e., reaching correct conclusions) and directional goals (i.e., reaching preferred conclusions) affect perceptions of majority preferences. Results show that motivated reasoning affects overestimates of support, of both national-level opinion and modal opinion in discussion groups, even after controlling for partisan strength, demographics, news exposure, political knowledge, and interest.

In the present article, we review our own and others’ research on manipulations, moderators, and consequences of realistic and symbolic threat, with close attention to the ways in which these threats are similar vs. diﬀerent. Given the growing racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity in the Western world, understanding how and under what conditions each type of threat can be causally induced is critical to reducing threat and ultimately improving intergroup harmony.},

            Racial disparities on socioeconomic indices expand dramatically during economic recession. Although prior explanations for this phenomenon have focused on institutional causes, our research reveals that perceived scarcity influences people’s visual representations of race in a way that may promote discrimination. Across four studies, scarce conditions led perceivers to view Black people as “darker” and “more stereotypically Black” in appearance, relative to control conditions, and this shift in perception under scarcity was sufficient to elicit reduced resource allocations to African American recipients. These findings introduce a “motivated perception” account for the proliferation of racial and ethnic discrimination during times of economic duress.
          , 
            When the economy declines, racial minorities are hit the hardest. Although existing explanations for this effect focus on institutional causes, recent psychological findings suggest that scarcity may also alter perceptions of race in ways that exacerbate discrimination. We tested the hypothesis that economic resource scarcity causes decision makers to perceive African Americans as “Blacker” and that this visual distortion elicits disparities in the allocation of resources. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that scarcity altered perceptions of race, lowering subjects’ psychophysical threshold for seeing a mixed-race face as “Black” as opposed to “White.” In studies 3 and 4, scarcity led subjects to visualize African American faces as darker and more “stereotypically Black,” compared with a control condition. When presented to naïve subjects, face representations produced under scarcity elicited smaller allocations than control-condition representations. Together, these findings introduce a novel perceptual account for the proliferation of racial disparities under economic scarcity.},

Using {MKDA}, a whole-brain based quantitative meta-analysis of recent {fMRI} studies of empathy was performed. This analysis identiﬁed the {dACC}-{aMCC}-{SMA} and bilateral anterior insula as being consistently activated in empathy. Hypothesizing that what are here termed affective–perceptual and cognitive–evaluative forms of empathy might be characterized by different activity patterns, the neural activations in these forms of empathy were compared. The dorsal {aMCC} was demonstrated to be recruited more frequently in the cognitive–evaluative form of empathy, whilst the right anterior insula was found to be involved in the affective–perceptual form of empathy only. The left anterior insula was active in both forms of empathy. It was concluded that the {dACC}-{aMCC}-{SMA} and bilateral insula can be considered as forming a core network in empathy, and that cognitive–evaluative and affective–perceptual empathy can be distinguished at the level of regional activation.},

	abstract = {Aggression occurs frequently and severely between rival groups. Although there has been much study into the psychological and socio-ecological determinants of intergroup aggression, the neuroscience of this phenomenon remains incomplete. To examine the neural correlates of aggression directed at outgroup (versus ingroup) targets, we recruited 35 healthy young male participants who were current or former students of the same university. While undergoing functional {MRI}, participants completed an aggression task against both an ingroup and an out­ group opponent in which their opponents repeatedly provoked them at varying levels and then participants could retaliate. Participants were then socially included and then excluded by two outgroup members and then completed the same aggression task against the same two oppo­ nents. Both before and after outgroup exclusion, aggression toward outgroup members was positively associated with activity in the ventral striatum during decisions about how aggressive to be toward their outgroup opponent. Aggression toward outgroup members was also linked to greater post-exclusion activity in the rostral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex during provocation from their outgroup opponent. These altered patterns of brain activity suggest that frontostriatal mechanisms may play a significant role in motivating aggression toward outgroup members.},

We recorded magnetoencephalography to pain and neutral expressions of Asian and White faces from White students who had stayed in China for 6–36 weeks (Experimental group) or 2–4 weeks (Control group). The experimental group showed better neural decoding of and greater insular/sensori­ motor responses to pain vs. neutral expressions of Asian compared to White faces. By contrast, the control group showed better neural decoding of pain vs. neutral expressions of White than Asian faces. In addition, participants of the experimental group who had stayed longer in China showed greater sensorimotor responses to pain (vs. neutral) expressions of Asian faces but weaker sensorimotor responses to pain (vs. neutral) expressions of White faces.

Deserved misfortune is pleasing and undeserved good fortune is displeasing. A third explanation concerns appraisal of the good or bad fortunes of others as creating either benefit or harm for the self or in-group. Especially in competitive situations and when envy is present, gain is pleasing and loss is displeasing.

In order to experience schadenfreude, it is not enough for the individual who is suffering to be a member of the opposing group, but also the perceived competitiveness level of the opposing group must be high. Although this basic assumption of Schadenfreude’s competitiveness is confirmed by self-report-based techniques, there is no study in the literature addressing the subject’s neural bases. The aim of this study is to test the competitiveness assumptions of schadenfreude using the electroencephalography-based {ERP} method. For this purpose, {EEG} re­ cordings were taken of 40 individuals who expressed themselves as belonging to a political party while watching the outgroup and ingroup party members in pain. Perception of competition levels of outgroup and ingroup members were manipulated during the study. The results show that pain empathy for the suffering individuals changes in relation to the competition level. Particularly related changes have been observed in late {ERP} components known to be related to consciousness. In this context, our study contributes to the literature as the first confirmation of the assumptions of schadenfreude competitiveness level by neuroscientific methodology.},

	abstract = {Most of daily life hums along peacefully but provocations tip the balance toward aggression. Negative feelings are often invoked to explain why people lash out after an insult. Yet people might retaliate because provocation makes aggression hedonically rewarding. To test this alternative hypothesis, 69 participants underwent functional neuroimaging while they completed a behavioral aggression task that repeatedly manipulated whether aggression was preceded by an instance of provocation or not. After provocation, greater activity in the nucleus accumbens ({NAcc}) (a brain region reliably associated with reward) during aggressive decisions predicted louder noise blasts administered in retaliation. Greater {NAcc} activation was also associated with participants’ history of real-world violence. Functional connectivity between the {NAcc} and a regulatory region in the lateral prefrontal cortex related to lower retaliatory aggression. These ﬁndings suggest that provocation tips the neural balance towards hedonic reward, which fosters retaliatory aggression. Although such pleasure of inﬂicting pain may promote retaliatory aggression, self-regulatory processes can keep such aggressive urges at bay. Implications for theory and violence reduction are discussed.},

In Study 1 we specify models testing the threat – hate – aggression paths. In Studies 2 (interpersonal hate) and 3 and 4 (intergroup hate) we manipulate realistic and symbolic threat perceptions, measuring hate and aggression. Across studies, hate is better predicted by symbolic than realistic threats. Also, hate consistently predicts aggressive tendencies and hurting behaviors, and interpersonal hate mediates the relationship between symbolic threats and the two aggressive behaviors while intergroup hate mediates the relationships between symbolic (and partially realistic) threats and the two aggressive behaviors.

In a block-design {fMRI} study, we scanned 17 normal human subjects while they viewed the face of a person they hated and also faces of acquaintances for whom they had neutral feelings. A hate score was obtained for the object of hate for each subject and this was used as a covariate in a between-subject random effects analysis. Viewing a hated face resulted in increased activity in the medial frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in premotor cortex, in the frontal pole and bilaterally in the medial insula. We also found three areas where activation correlated linearly with the declared level of hatred, the right insula, right premotor cortex and the right fronto-medial gyrus. One area of deactivation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus. The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate. Though distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love, this pattern nevertheless shares two areas with the latter, namely the putamen and the insula.},

	abstract = {When economic resources are scarce, racial minorities are often devalued and disenfranchised. We proposed that this pattern extends to visual processing, such that the encoding of minority group faces is disrupted under scarcity—an effect that may facilitate discrimination and contribute to racial disparities. Specifically, we used {EEG} and {fMRI} to test whether scarce economic conditions induce deficits in neural encoding of Black faces, and we examined whether this effect is associated with discriminatory resource allocation in behavior. In Study 1, framing resources as scarce (vs. neutral) selectively impaired the neural encoding of Black (vs. White) faces, as indexed by a delayed face-related N170 {ERP} response, and the degree of this encoding deficit predicted anti-Black allocation decisions. In Study 2, we replicated and extended this effect using {fMRI}: Resources framed as scarce (vs. neutral) reduced face-sensitive fusiform activity to Black (vs. White) faces. Furthermore, scarcity-decreased fusiform activity to Black faces corresponded with decreased valuation-related striatum activity to predict anti-Black allocation decisions. These findings suggest that impaired visual processing and devaluation occur selectively for minorities under scarcity—an implicit effect that may promote discrimination and contribute to rising disparities observed during economic stress.},

In investigations of faces of different races, research has repeatedly demonstrated an Own Race Bias in which people are more accurate in recognizing racial ingroup compared to outgroup members. The primary goal of this research was to investigate whether participants from typically underrepresented populations in social psychological research (i.e., Blacks, South Asians, and East Asians) show biases in recognition accuracy when presented with ingroup faces and minority and majority outgroup faces. Not surprisingly, across three experiments, participants demonstrated superior recognition for faces of members of their own compared to other races. Although minority participants also demonstrated greater recognition accuracy for majority compared to minority outgroup faces, these effects were much smaller and typically nonsignificant. The implications of these findings for our understanding of basic processes in face perception, and intergroup relations, are discussed.},

In three experiments, participants were assigned to a mixed-race minimal group and showed own-group bias toward this minimal group, regardless of race. Own-group bias was mediated by attention toward own-group faces during encoding (Experiment 1). Furthermore, participants who were highly identified with their minimal group had the largest own-group bias (Experiment 2).

Do they suffer from in-group biases (own-race-bias and own-agebias), and mimic the human behaviour? Is in-group speciﬁc information being encoded sub-consciously by the deep networks? This research attempts to answer these questions and presents an in-depth analysis of ‘bias’ in deep learning based face recognition systems. This is the ﬁrst work which decodes if and where bias is encoded for face recognition. Taking cues from cognitive studies, we inspect if deep networks are also affected by social in- and out-group effect. Networks are analyzed for own-race and own-age bias, both of which have been well established in human beings. The sub-conscious behavior of face recognition models is examined to understand if they encode race or age speciﬁc features for face recognition. Analysis is performed based on 36 experiments conducted on multiple datasets. Four deep learning networks either trained from scratch or pre-trained on over 10M images are used. Variations across class activation maps and feature visualizations provide novel insights into the functioning of deep learning systems, suggesting behavior similar to humans. It is our belief that a better understanding of state-of-the-art deep learning networks would enable researchers to address the given challenge of bias in {AI}, and develop fairer systems.},

To what degree category bias develops when learning goals emphasize individuation of each stimulus and whether the bias emerges spontaneously during learning itself rather than in response to task demands is unclear. Here, we used functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) during encoding to test for category biases in neural representations of individual stimuli during learning. Human participants (males and females) encountered face-blend stimuli with unique first names and shared family names that indicated category membership. Participants were instructed to learn the full name for each face. Neural pattern classification and pattern similarity analyses were used to track category information in the brain. Results showed that stimulus category could be decoded during encoding across many frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Furthermore, two stimuli from the same category were represented more similarly in the prefrontal cortex than two stimuli from different categories equated for physical similarity. These findings illustrate that a mere presence of category label can bias neural representations spontaneously during encoding to emphasize category-relevant information, even in the absence of explicit categorization demands and when category-irrelevant information remains relevant for task goals.

These results may inform our understanding of bias in general and suggest that bias may emerge when category information is present even when one's explicit focus is on individuals.},

Recent work suggests that subtle differences in how novel Black faces are initially perceived relate to prejudicial behavior. One such difference is that non-Black people attend more to the eyes of White versus Black novel faces. The present study sought to better characterize this difference by assessing how distinct individual differences widely shown to relate to prejudicial behavior—internal motivation to respond without prejudice ({IMS}), external motivation to respond without prejudice ({EMS}), and implicit race bias—relate to disparities in attending to the eyes of novel Black and White faces. Participants viewed novel Black and White faces one at a time on the right or left side of the display. Replicating a race-based disparity in visual attention to the eyes, non-Black perceivers fixated more on the eyes of White in comparison to Black faces. Individual differences among perceivers corresponded with the extent of this race-based disparity. {IMS} had a negative relationship with a race-based disparity in attention to the eyes, such that higher levels of {IMS} among perceivers corresponded with lower disparities in attention. Implicit race bias had a positive relationship with this disparity, such that higher levels of implicit race bias among perceivers corresponded with higher disparities in attention. Together, these findings illustrate that two individual differences known to affect prejudicial behavior are associated with preferential gaze patterns in visual attention toward faces on the basis of race.},

Here, we argue that the evidence supporting the social–motivational approach derives from a particular cultural setting: a high socio-economic status group (typically {US} Whites) looking at the faces of a lower status group ({US} Blacks) with whom observers typically have at least moderate perceptual experience. In contrast, we test motivation-to-individuate instructions across ﬁve studies covering an extremely wide range of perceptual experience, in a cultural setting of more equal socio-economic status, namely Asian and Caucasian participants (N = 480) tested on Asian and Caucasian faces. We ﬁnd no social–motivational component at all to the {ORE}, speciﬁcally: no reduction in the {ORE} with motivation instructions, including for novel images of the faces, and at all experience levels; no increase in correlation between own- and other-race face recognition, implying no increase in shared processes; and greater (not the predicted less) effort applied to distinguishing other-race faces than own-race faces under normal (‘‘no instructions’’) conditions. Instead, the {ORE} was predicted by level of contact with the other-race. Our results reject both pure social–motivational theories and also the recent Categorization-Individuation model of Hugenberg, Young, Bernstein, and Sacco (2010). We propose a new dual-route approach to the {ORE}, in which there are two causes of the {ORE}—lack of motivation, and lack of experience—that contribute differently across varying world locations and cultural settings.

            People often find it more difficult to recognize other- than own-race faces. This other-race effect is robust across numerous ethnic groups. Yet, it remains unclear how this effect changes in people who live in a multiracial environment, and in immigrants whose lifetime perceptual experience changes over time. In the present study, we developed a novel face recognition test that approximates face recognition in the real world. We tested five groups of White and East Asian adults (n = 120) living in racially homogeneous versus heterogeneous cities and East Asians who immigrated to a multiracial city between infancy and adulthood. Multiracial cities reduce the other-race effect. The magnitude of the other-race effect changes as a function of experience, mirroring the racial diversity in perceivers’ living environment. Our study highlights the challenge of forming reliable face representations across naturalistic facial variability and suggests a facilitative role of multiracial environments in eliminating the other-race effect.},

	abstract = {When economic resources are scarce, racial minorities are often devalued and disenfranchised. We proposed that this pattern extends to visual processing, such that the encoding of minority group faces is disrupted under scarcity—an effect that may facilitate discrimination and contribute to racial disparities. Specifically, we used {EEG} and {fMRI} to test whether scarce economic conditions induce deficits in neural encoding of Black faces, and we examined whether this effect is associated with discriminatory resource allocation in behavior. In Study 1, framing resources as scarce (vs. neutral) selectively impaired the neural encoding of Black (vs. White) faces, as indexed by a delayed face-related N170 {ERP} response, and the degree of this encoding deficit predicted anti-Black allocation decisions. In Study 2, we replicated and extended this effect using {fMRI}: Resources framed as scarce (vs. neutral) reduced face-sensitive fusiform activity to Black (vs. White) faces. Furthermore, scarcity-decreased fusiform activity to Black faces corresponded with decreased valuation-related striatum activity to predict anti-Black allocation decisions. These findings suggest that impaired visual processing and devaluation occur selectively for minorities under scarcity—an implicit effect that may promote discrimination and contribute to rising disparities observed during economic stress.},

This categorization-individuation model offers not only a parsimonious account of both classic and recent evidence for category-based biases in face recognition but also links the {ORE} to broader evidence and theory in social cognition and face perception. Finally, the categorization-individuation model makes a series of novel predictions for how the {ORE} can be exacerbated, attenuated, or even eliminated via perceptual and motivational processes, both by improving other-race recognition and by reducing same-race recognition.

In this paper, we consider three possible accounts of the autism face deﬁcit: (1) the holistic hypothesis, (2) the local perceptual bias hypothesis and (3) the eye avoidance hypothesis. A review of the literature indicates that contrary to the holistic hypothesis, there is little evidence to suggest that individuals with autism do perceive faces holistically. The local perceptual bias account also fails to explain the selective advantage that {ASD} individuals demonstrate for objects and their selective disadvantage for faces. The eye avoidance hypothesis provides a plausible explanation of face recognition deﬁcits where individuals with {ASD} avoid the eye region because it is perceived as socially threatening. Direct eye contact elicits a increased physiological response as indicated by heightened skin conductance and amygdala activity. For individuals with autism, avoiding the eyes is an adaptive strategy, however, this approach interferes with the ability to process facial cues of identity, expressions and intentions, exacerbating the social challenges for persons with {ASD}.},

We find no evidence that the relationship differs for measures of holistic/configural processing compared with normal processing.

Do they suffer from in-group biases (own-race-bias and own-agebias), and mimic the human behaviour? Is in-group speciﬁc information being encoded sub-consciously by the deep networks? This research attempts to answer these questions and presents an in-depth analysis of ‘bias’ in deep learning based face recognition systems. This is the ﬁrst work which decodes if and where bias is encoded for face recognition. Taking cues from cognitive studies, we inspect if deep networks are also affected by social in- and out-group effect. Networks are analyzed for own-race and own-age bias, both of which have been well established in human beings. The sub-conscious behavior of face recognition models is examined to understand if they encode race or age speciﬁc features for face recognition. Analysis is performed based on 36 experiments conducted on multiple datasets. Four deep learning networks either trained from scratch or pre-trained on over 10M images are used. Variations across class activation maps and feature visualizations provide novel insights into the functioning of deep learning systems, suggesting behavior similar to humans. It is our belief that a better understanding of state-of-the-art deep learning networks would enable researchers to address the given challenge of bias in {AI}, and develop fairer systems.},

	abstract = {When economic resources are scarce, racial minorities are often devalued and disenfranchised. We proposed that this pattern extends to visual processing, such that the encoding of minority group faces is disrupted under scarcity—an effect that may facilitate discrimination and contribute to racial disparities. Specifically, we used {EEG} and {fMRI} to test whether scarce economic conditions induce deficits in neural encoding of Black faces, and we examined whether this effect is associated with discriminatory resource allocation in behavior. In Study 1, framing resources as scarce (vs. neutral) selectively impaired the neural encoding of Black (vs. White) faces, as indexed by a delayed face-related N170 {ERP} response, and the degree of this encoding deficit predicted anti-Black allocation decisions. In Study 2, we replicated and extended this effect using {fMRI}: Resources framed as scarce (vs. neutral) reduced face-sensitive fusiform activity to Black (vs. White) faces. Furthermore, scarcity-decreased fusiform activity to Black faces corresponded with decreased valuation-related striatum activity to predict anti-Black allocation decisions. These findings suggest that impaired visual processing and devaluation occur selectively for minorities under scarcity—an implicit effect that may promote discrimination and contribute to rising disparities observed during economic stress.},

Experiment 2 used realworld categories of football (soccer) teams, with the out-group representing a high or low threat to the in-group.

Analysis of eye movements for test faces showed more interfeatural saccades when they followed a blurred face, and longer gaze duration within the same feature when they followed scrambled faces. In experiment 2, we used a similar paradigm except that test faces were cued by intact faces, lowlevel blurred stimuli, or second-order scrambled stimuli (features were cut out but maintained their first-order relations). We found that in the intact condition participants performed fewer interfeatural saccades than in low-level blurred condition and had shorter gaze duration than in second-order scrambled condition.

To what degree category bias develops when learning goals emphasize individuation of each stimulus and whether the bias emerges spontaneously during learning itself rather than in response to task demands is unclear. Here, we used functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) during encoding to test for category biases in neural representations of individual stimuli during learning. Human participants (males and females) encountered face-blend stimuli with unique first names and shared family names that indicated category membership. Participants were instructed to learn the full name for each face. Neural pattern classification and pattern similarity analyses were used to track category information in the brain. Results showed that stimulus category could be decoded during encoding across many frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Furthermore, two stimuli from the same category were represented more similarly in the prefrontal cortex than two stimuli from different categories equated for physical similarity. These findings illustrate that a mere presence of category label can bias neural representations spontaneously during encoding to emphasize category-relevant information, even in the absence of explicit categorization demands and when category-irrelevant information remains relevant for task goals.

These results may inform our understanding of bias in general and suggest that bias may emerge when category information is present even when one's explicit focus is on individuals.},

Recent work suggests that subtle differences in how novel Black faces are initially perceived relate to prejudicial behavior. One such difference is that non-Black people attend more to the eyes of White versus Black novel faces. The present study sought to better characterize this difference by assessing how distinct individual differences widely shown to relate to prejudicial behavior—internal motivation to respond without prejudice ({IMS}), external motivation to respond without prejudice ({EMS}), and implicit race bias—relate to disparities in attending to the eyes of novel Black and White faces. Participants viewed novel Black and White faces one at a time on the right or left side of the display. Replicating a race-based disparity in visual attention to the eyes, non-Black perceivers fixated more on the eyes of White in comparison to Black faces. Individual differences among perceivers corresponded with the extent of this race-based disparity. {IMS} had a negative relationship with a race-based disparity in attention to the eyes, such that higher levels of {IMS} among perceivers corresponded with lower disparities in attention. Implicit race bias had a positive relationship with this disparity, such that higher levels of implicit race bias among perceivers corresponded with higher disparities in attention. Together, these findings illustrate that two individual differences known to affect prejudicial behavior are associated with preferential gaze patterns in visual attention toward faces on the basis of race.},

Here, we argue that the evidence supporting the social–motivational approach derives from a particular cultural setting: a high socio-economic status group (typically {US} Whites) looking at the faces of a lower status group ({US} Blacks) with whom observers typically have at least moderate perceptual experience. In contrast, we test motivation-to-individuate instructions across ﬁve studies covering an extremely wide range of perceptual experience, in a cultural setting of more equal socio-economic status, namely Asian and Caucasian participants (N = 480) tested on Asian and Caucasian faces. We ﬁnd no social–motivational component at all to the {ORE}, speciﬁcally: no reduction in the {ORE} with motivation instructions, including for novel images of the faces, and at all experience levels; no increase in correlation between own- and other-race face recognition, implying no increase in shared processes; and greater (not the predicted less) effort applied to distinguishing other-race faces than own-race faces under normal (‘‘no instructions’’) conditions. Instead, the {ORE} was predicted by level of contact with the other-race. Our results reject both pure social–motivational theories and also the recent Categorization-Individuation model of Hugenberg, Young, Bernstein, and Sacco (2010). We propose a new dual-route approach to the {ORE}, in which there are two causes of the {ORE}—lack of motivation, and lack of experience—that contribute differently across varying world locations and cultural settings.

In the present study, we developed a novel face recognition test that approximates face recognition in the real world. We tested five groups of White and East Asian adults (n = 120) living in racially homogeneous versus heterogeneous cities and East Asians who immigrated to a multiracial city between infancy and adulthood. Multiracial cities reduce the other-race effect. The magnitude of the other-race effect changes as a function of experience, mirroring the racial diversity in perceivers’ living environment. Our study highlights the challenge of forming reliable face representations across naturalistic facial variability and suggests a facilitative role of multiracial environments in eliminating the other-race effect.},

In investigations of faces of different races, research has repeatedly demonstrated an Own Race Bias in which people are more accurate in recognizing racial ingroup compared to outgroup members. The primary goal of this research was to investigate whether participants from typically underrepresented populations in social psychological research (i.e., Blacks, South Asians, and East Asians) show biases in recognition accuracy when presented with ingroup faces and minority and majority outgroup faces. Not surprisingly, across three experiments, participants demonstrated superior recognition for faces of members of their own compared to other races. Although minority participants also demonstrated greater recognition accuracy for majority compared to minority outgroup faces, these effects were much smaller and typically nonsignificant. The implications of these findings for our understanding of basic processes in face perception, and intergroup relations, are discussed.},

In three experiments, participants were assigned to a mixed-race minimal group and showed own-group bias toward this minimal group, regardless of race. Own-group bias was mediated by attention toward own-group faces during encoding (Experiment 1). Furthermore, participants who were highly identified with their minimal group had the largest own-group bias (Experiment 2). However, social affordances attenuated own-group bias—Memory for other-group faces was heightened among participants who were assigned to a role (i.e., spy) that required attention toward other-group members (Experiment 3).This research suggests that social identity may provide novel insights into person memory.},

The results show that while all mono-oriented objects tend to be more difficult to remember when upside-down, faces are disproportionately affected. These findings suggest that the difficulty in looking at upside-down faces involves 2 factors: a general factor of familiarity with mono-oriented objects, and a special factor related only to faces.

On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than {VGG} nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classiﬁcation task.

Participants made speeded ‘‘same-different” judgments to all possible combinations of faces, from which we generated psychological spaces, with ‘‘different” {RTs} as the measure of similarity. Consistent with the {MDS} framework, all faces were pseudo-normally distributed around the (unseen) prototype. The distribution of faces was consistent with Valentine’s (1991) predictions: despite their physical identity to the White faces, Black faces had lower mean inter-object distances in psychological space. Other-race faces are more densely clustered in psychological space, which could underlie well-known recognition deﬁcits.},

	abstract = {In this paper we argue that predictive processing ({PP}) theory cannot account for the phenomenon of affectbiased attention – prioritized attention to stimuli that are affectively salient because of their associations with reward or punishment. Specifically, the {PP} hypothesis that selective attention can be analyzed in terms of the optimization of precision expectations cannot accommodate affect-biased attention; affectively salient stimuli can capture our attention even when precision expectations are low. We review the prospects of three recent attempts to accommodate affect with tools internal to {PP} theory: Miller and Clark's (2018) embodied inference; Seth's (2013) interoceptive inference; and Joffily and Coricelli's (2013) rate of change of free energy. In each case we argue that the account does not resolve the challenge from affect-biased attention. For this reason, we conclude that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to explain all mental phenomena, contrary to the claim that the {PP} framework provides a unified theory of all mental phenomena or the brain's cognitive functioning. Nevertheless, we suggest that empirical investigation of the interaction between affective salience and precision expectations should prove helpful in understanding the limits of {PP} theory, and may provide new directions for the application of a Bayesian perspective to perception.},

In the picture we develop, online cognitive function cannot be assigned to either the cortical or the sub-cortical component, but instead emerges from their tight co-ordination. This tight co-ordination involves processes of continuous reciprocal causation that weave together bodily information and ‘top-down’ predictions, generating a uniﬁed sense of what’s out there and why it matters.

	abstract = {The predictive processing framework posits that people continuously use predictive principles when interacting with, learning from, and interpreting their surroundings. Here, we suggest that the same framework may help explain how people process self-relevant knowledge and maintain a stable and positive self-concept. Speciﬁcally, we recast two prominent self-relevant motivations, self-veriﬁcation and self-enhancement, in predictive processing ({PP}) terms. We suggest that these self-relevant motivations interact with the self-concept (i.e., priors) to create strong predictions. These predictions, in turn, inﬂuence how people interpret information about themselves. In particular, we argue that these strong self-relevant predictions dictate how prediction error, the deviation from the original prediction, is processed. In contrast to many implementations of the {PP} framework, we suggest that predictions and priors emanating from stable constructs (such as the self-concept) cultivate belief-maintaining, rather than beliefupdating, dynamics. Based on recent ﬁndings, we also postulate that evidence supporting a predicted model of the self (or interpreted as such) triggers subjective reward responses, potentially reinforcing existing beliefs. Characterizing the role of rewards in self-belief maintenance and reframing self-relevant motivations and rewards in predictive processing terms offers novel insights into how the self is maintained in neurotypical adults, as well as in pathological populations, potentially pointing to therapeutic implications.},

By now, a number of different biases have been identified and empirically demonstrated. Unfortunately, however, these biases have often been examined in separate lines of research, thereby precluding the recognition of shared principles. Here we argue that several—so far mostly unrelated—biases (e.g., bias blind spot, hostile media bias, egocentric/ethnocentric bias, outcome bias) can be traced back to the combination of a fundamental prior belief and humans’ tendency toward belief-consistent information processing. What varies between different biases is essentially the specific belief that guides information processing. More importantly, we propose that different biases even share the same underlying belief and differ only in the specific outcome of information processing that is assessed (i.e., the dependent variable), thus tapping into different manifestations of the same latent information processing. In other words, we propose for discussion a model that suffices to explain several different biases. We thereby suggest a more parsimonious approach compared with current theoretical explanations of these biases. We also generate novel hypotheses that follow directly from the integrative nature of our perspective.},

Replicating past work on confirmation bias, patterns in the conditions with feedback indicated that pieces of stereotype-confirming evidence exerted more influence than stereotype-disconfirming evidence. Par­ ticipants in the Stereotype-Confirming condition stereotyped more over time, but rates of stereotyping for par­ ticipants in the Stereotype-Disconfirming condition remained unchanged.

Participants made judgments and received a mix of confirmatory, disconfirmatory, and no feedback and were subsequently asked to remember the feedback they received on each trial, if any.

            People often find it more difficult to recognize other- than own-race faces. This other-race effect is robust across numerous ethnic groups. Yet, it remains unclear how this effect changes in people who live in a multiracial environment, and in immigrants whose lifetime perceptual experience changes over time. In the present study, we developed a novel face recognition test that approximates face recognition in the real world. We tested five groups of White and East Asian adults (n = 120) living in racially homogeneous versus heterogeneous cities and East Asians who immigrated to a multiracial city between infancy and adulthood. Multiracial cities reduce the other-race effect. The magnitude of the other-race effect changes as a function of experience, mirroring the racial diversity in perceivers’ living environment. Our study highlights the challenge of forming reliable face representations across naturalistic facial variability and suggests a facilitative role of multiracial environments in eliminating the other-race effect.},

We conduct a new meta-analysis based on 20 years of additional data to update the estimate of this relationship and examine theoretical and methodological moderators of the effect. We find a meta-analytic effect of r = −.15. In line with theoretical predictions, we find some evidence that the magnitude of this relationship is stronger when contact occurs during childhood rather than adulthood. We find no evidence that the relationship differs for measures of holistic/configural processing compared with normal processing. Finally, we find that the magnitude of the relationship depends on the operationalization of contact and that it is strongest when contact is manipulated.

Despite the pervasive influence of status on social behavior, how information about the status of others is represented in the brain remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that social-status information is embedded in our neural representations of other individuals. Participants learned to associate faces with names, job titles that that varied in associated status, and explicit markers of reputational status (star ratings). Trained stimuli were presented in an {fMRI} experiment where participants performed a target detection task orthogonal to the variable of interest. A network of face-selective brain regions extending from the occipital lobe to the orbitofrontal cortex was localized and served as regions of interest. Using multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that face-selective voxels in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex – a region involved in social and nonsocial valuation, could decode faces based on their status. Similar effects were observed with two different status manipulations – one based on stored semantic knowledge (e.g. different careers) and one based on learned reputation (e.g. star ranking). These data suggest that a face-selective region of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex may contribute to the perception of social status, potentially underlying the preferential attention and favorable biases humans display toward high status individuals.},

In three experiments, participants were assigned to a mixed-race minimal group and showed own-group bias toward this minimal group, regardless of race. Own-group bias was mediated by attention toward own-group faces during encoding (Experiment 1). Furthermore, participants who were highly identified with their minimal group had the largest own-group bias (Experiment 2).

Across six experiments, Black, White, Asian and Latinx American participants consistently demonstrated better recognition memory for the faces of relatively higher-­status racial/ ethnic group members than those of lower-­status groups. This higher-­status recognition advantage even appeared to override the {ORE}, such that participants better recognized members of higher-­status outgroups—­but not an outgroup of equivalent status—­compared to members of their own ingroup. However, across a variety of self-­reported perceived status measures, status differences between the high-­and low-­status groups generally did not moderate the documented recognition advantage.

	abstract = {Fixating someone suddenly moving the eyes is known to trigger a corresponding shift of attention in the observer. This phenomenon, known as gaze-cueing effect, can be modulated as a function of the social status of the individual depicted in the cueing face. Here, in two experiments, we investigated the temporal dynamics underlying this modulation. To this end, a gaze-cueing paradigm was implemented in which centrally-placed faces depicting high- and low-status individuals suddenly shifted the eyes towards a location either spatially congruent or incongruent with that occupied by a subsequent target stimulus. Social status was manipulated by presenting fictive Curriculum Vitae before the experimental phase. In Experiment 1, in which two temporal intervals (50 ms vs. 900 ms) occurred between the direct-gaze face and the avertedgaze face onsets, a stronger gaze-cueing effect in response to high-status faces than low-status faces was observed, irrespective of the time participants were allowed for extracting social information. In Experiment 2, in which two temporal intervals (200 ms vs. 1000 ms) occurred between the averted-gaze face and target onset, a stronger gaze cueing for highstatus faces was observed at the shorter interval only. Taken together, these results suggest that information regarding social status is extracted from faces rapidly (Experiment 1), and that the tendency to selectively attend to the locations gazed by high-status individuals may decay with time (Experiment 2).},

            The other-race effect refers to the phenomenon in which the chance of individuals misidentifying faces from other races more than their own race is significantly higher. This study explored the effect of motivation on the other-race effect by manipulating the social status of faces. The results showed that: (1) compared to other-race faces with low social status, when individuals' perceptions of the social status of other-race faces increased, individuals' recognition scores for high social status other-race faces increased, and the other-race effect disappeared, and (2) when individuals' perceptions of the social status of other-race faces decreased, there was no significant difference in individuals' recognition scores of other-race faces, of either high or low social status. These findings suggest that motivation has a significant impact on the other-race effect.},

Experiment 2 used realworld categories of football (soccer) teams, with the out-group representing a high or low threat to the in-group.

It is therefore surprising that few studies have investigated the impact of intergroup contexts and motivations on attention to the eyes of ingroup and outgroup members. Four experiments investigated differences in eye gaze to racial and novel ingroups using eye tracker technology. Whereas Studies 1 and 3 demonstrated that White participants attended more to the eyes of White compared to Black targets, Study 2 showed a similar pattern of attention to the eyes of novel ingroup and outgroup faces. Studies 3 and 4 also provided new evidence that eye gaze is flexible and can be meaningfully influenced by current motivations. Specifically, instructions to individuate specific social categories increased attention to the eyes of target group members. Furthermore, the latter experiments demonstrated that preferential attention to the eyes of ingroup members predicted important intergroup biases such as recognition of ingroup over outgroup faces (i.e., the own-race bias; Study 3) and willingness to interact with outgroup members (Study 4). The implication of these findings for general theorizing on face perception, individuation processes, and intergroup relations are discussed.},

	abstract = {When economic resources are scarce, racial minorities are often devalued and disenfranchised. We proposed that this pattern extends to visual processing, such that the encoding of minority group faces is disrupted under scarcity—an effect that may facilitate discrimination and contribute to racial disparities. Specifically, we used {EEG} and {fMRI} to test whether scarce economic conditions induce deficits in neural encoding of Black faces, and we examined whether this effect is associated with discriminatory resource allocation in behavior. In Study 1, framing resources as scarce (vs. neutral) selectively impaired the neural encoding of Black (vs. White) faces, as indexed by a delayed face-related N170 {ERP} response, and the degree of this encoding deficit predicted anti-Black allocation decisions. In Study 2, we replicated and extended this effect using {fMRI}: Resources framed as scarce (vs. neutral) reduced face-sensitive fusiform activity to Black (vs. White) faces. Furthermore, scarcity-decreased fusiform activity to Black faces corresponded with decreased valuation-related striatum activity to predict anti-Black allocation decisions. These findings suggest that impaired visual processing and devaluation occur selectively for minorities under scarcity—an implicit effect that may promote discrimination and contribute to rising disparities observed during economic stress.},

Do they suffer from in-group biases (own-race-bias and own-agebias), and mimic the human behaviour? Is in-group speciﬁc information being encoded sub-consciously by the deep networks? This research attempts to answer these questions and presents an in-depth analysis of ‘bias’ in deep learning based face recognition systems. This is the ﬁrst work which decodes if and where bias is encoded for face recognition. Taking cues from cognitive studies, we inspect if deep networks are also affected by social in- and out-group effect. Networks are analyzed for own-race and own-age bias, both of which have been well established in human beings. The sub-conscious behavior of face recognition models is examined to understand if they encode race or age speciﬁc features for face recognition. Analysis is performed based on 36 experiments conducted on multiple datasets. Four deep learning networks either trained from scratch or pre-trained on over 10M images are used. Variations across class activation maps and feature visualizations provide novel insights into the functioning of deep learning systems, suggesting behavior similar to humans. It is our belief that a better understanding of state-of-the-art deep learning networks would enable researchers to address the given challenge of bias in {AI}, and develop fairer systems.},

            Social status can be attained through either dominance (coercion and intimidation) or prestige (skill and respect). Individuals high in either of these status pathways are known to more readily attract gaze and covert spatial attention compared to their low-status counterparts. However it is not known if social status biases allocation of attentional resources to competing stimuli. To address this issue, we used an attentional blink paradigm to explore non-spatial attentional biases in response to face stimuli varying in dominance and prestige. Results from a series of studies consistently indicated that participants were biased towards allocating attention to low- relative to high- dominance faces. We also observed no effects of manipulating prestige on attentional bias. We attribute our results to the workings of comparatively early processing stages, separate from those mediating spatial attention shifts, which are tuned to physical features associated with low dominance. These findings challenge our current understanding of the impact of social status on attentional competition.},

Following this status-inducing phase, participants were engaged in a joint grasping task with the high- and low-status confederates in different sessions while behavioural (i.e., interpersonal asynchrony and movement start time) indexes were measured. Participants’ performance in the task (i.e., level of interpersonal asynchrony) when interacting with the low-status partner was modulated by their preference for him. The lower participants’ preference for a low- relative to a high-status confederate, the worse participants’ performance when interacting with the low-status confederate.

In contrast with earlier {EEG} studies that typically manipulate social rank through competitive situations, we implemented hierarchy through occupational status and thus contrasted faces associated with high- vs. low-status (e.g. lawyer vs. waiter). Since social hierarchies are largely intertwined with gender, both female and male faces were used as stimuli, and both female and male participants were tested. The procedure consisted in presenting a status label before the face it was associated with. The analyses focused mainly on two components that have been shown to be modulated by competitive hierarchies and other social contexts, namely the N170 and the Late Positive Potential ({LPP}). The results indicated that gender, but not status, modulated the N170 amplitude. Moreover, high-status faces elicited larger {LPP} amplitude than low-status faces but this diﬀerence was driven by female participants. This gender eﬀect is discussed in line with research showing that women and men are sensitive to diﬀerent kinds of hierarchy. Methodological diﬀerences are considered to account for the discrepancy between studies that ﬁnd an eﬀect of hierarchy on the N170 and those that do not.},

	abstract = {Using eye-tracking methodology, the current study investigates how people look at faces in the context of a social hierarchy. The first goal of the study was to characterize how participants distribute their attentional resources to a set of faces displayed on a vertical hierarchical scale including three social ranks (high, middle and low). In the first phase of the experiment, participants had to learn a hierarchy based on performance in competitive games. The participants’ rank, the other players’ rank, and the spatial orientation of the scale (highest social rank at the top of the vertical scale vs. highest social rank at the bottom) were manipulated. The results revealed that participants looked more at other players who occupy the highest than the lowest social rank but did not look more at another player who was ranked higher than lower than themselves when that player was in the middle position. Hence, participants were more sensitive to the highest vs. lowest rank contrast than to the higher vs. lower rank contrast. The results also revealed an influence of spatial orientation of the scale: less visual attention was allocated to the highest-ranking players when they appeared at the bottom than at the top of the spatial scale. The second goal of the study was to investigate how participants explored the face of each player. This was addressed in the second phase of the experiment, in which participants were presented with each player’s face individually. The results did not show any effect of players’ rank but revealed that in some circumstances, participants in the higher-ranking position were less likely to allocate visual resources to other players.},

Almost 20 years ago, Henrich and Gil-White (H\&{GW}) suggested that people use indirect cues of success (e.g., differential levels of attention paid to models by other social learners) as adaptive short-cuts to select models from whom to learn. They called this use of indirect markers of success prestige bias. In this review, we re-visit H\&{GW}’s proposal, examining the evidence amassed since for the adaptiveness and use of prestige bias in humans. First, we brieﬂy outline H\&{GW}’s theory. Second, we analyse whether prestige is associated with competence within valuable domains, which is a crucial assumption underlying the adaptiveness of prestige bias. Third, we discuss prestige cues that people use to infer success (e.g., the amount of voluntary deference and attention received by models). Fourth, we examine the evidence for and against the use of prestige bias in human adults and children. Finally, we point out limitations in the current literature and present new avenues for research on prestige bias.},

We note that people frequently obtain larger samples of information about in-groups than about out-groups. Using computer simulations, we show that this asymmetry in sample sizes implies the in-group heterogeneity effect under a wide range of assumptions about how experience affects perceived variability. This is the case even when perceived variability is the outcome of rational information processing, implying that the structure of the environment is sufficient to explain the emergence of the in-group heterogeneity effect. A key assumption of our explanation is that perceived group variability depends on the size of the sample observed about this group. We provide evidence in support for this assumption in two experiments. Our results considerably expand the scope and relevance of a prior sampling explanation proposed by Linville, Fischer, and Salovey (1989). They also complement other explanations that proposed that information about in-groups and out-groups is processed differently.},

However, due to the stimuli used in electctrophysiological ({EEG}) research (i.e., photos of static pain expressions) and low temporal resolutions of neural activity reported in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) studies, it remains unclear how dynamic neural responses to subtle variations of pain expressions are shaped by perceived race in the ﬁrst few hundreds of milliseconds after face onset. We tested the hypothesis of greater sensitivity to subtle variations of pain expressions of same-race than other-race faces by integrating psychophysical and {EEG} responses to increasing amount of pixels of pain expressions applied to neutral faces. Experiment 1 found that adults required fewer painful pixels to perceive pain expression of same-race than other-race faces. Experiment 2 showed that the amplitude of a positivity activity at 140–190 ms over the frontal/ central electrodes (P2) increased faster in response to the increasing amount of painful pixels of same-race than other-race faces.

Research suggests that compared to majority and dominant group members, minority and subordinate group members tend to experience chronic stigma, resulting in more negative life outcomes (e.g., educational and occupational attainment). We argue that theory and research exploring face perception has not led to models that incorporate how the chronic experience of stigma may impact judgments, reflecting a gap with potential consequences for the validity and generalizability of the theories developed. We propose a framework for understanding how experiencing a socially stigmatized racial identity may lead perceivers to engage in face processing differently from their non-stigmatized counterparts. With a focus on the literature examining the cross-race effect, we explore the potential impact of chronic social stigma on three theorized moderators guiding processing and memory for same-versus cross-race faces. Our analysis suggests that future research focusing on stigmatized perceivers could help to explain some variation in findings, lead to novel theoretical development, and ultimately produce more generalizable research across several domains of inquiry.},

	abstract = {Some social categories are almost always identiﬁable in face-to-face interaction (e.g., race and gender). Information about many other category memberships (e.g., religion, sexual orientation) can be uncertain, however. This work explores the inﬂuence of uncertainty about category information on face recognition. Current accounts of intergroup bias in face recognition (speciﬁcally, the feature selection model and categorization-individuation model) are extended to predict that uncertainty about category information would undermine later recognition of another person. Experiment 1 provided an initial test of this hypothesis by comparing recognition of faces for which category membership was uncertain to recognition of faces belonging to certain ingroup and outgroup members. Experiment 2 used a diﬀerent comparison group (a threatening outgroup) in order to rule out two alternative interpretations of Experiment 1. Finally, Experiment 3 manipulated category uncertainty without direct reference to outgroup membership in order to address the possibility that uncertain group memberships might be redeﬁned as an entitative outgroup. Across experiments, results converged to indicate that uncertainty about category information undermined face recognition. These results buttress current accounts of facial recognition bias by successfully extending them to a new domain, extend theoretical treatments of motivation as an antecedent variable in face recognition, apply a boundary condition to the inﬂuence of threatening stimuli on bias in face recognition, call into question recent ﬁndings about the cognitive system's treatment of uncategorized individuals, and identify uncertainty as a determinant of person perception.},

In addition, their faces were misrecollected as more prototypically dominant in physical appearance than they actually were (Studies 1A, 1B, and 2).

              Evidence from social psychology suggests that men compared to women more readily display and pursue control over human resources or capital. However, studying how status and gender shape deliberate impression formation is difficult due to social desirability concerns. Using univariate and multivariate {fMRI} analyses (
              n
               = 65), we examined how gender and socioeconomic status ({SES}) may influence brain responses during deliberate but private impression formation. Men more than women showed greater activity in the {VMPFC} and {NAcc} when forming impressions of high-{SES} (vs. low-{SES}) targets. Seed partial least squares ({PLS}) analysis showed that this {SES}-based increase in {VMPFC} activity was associated with greater co-activation across an evaluative network for the high-{SES} versus low-{SES} univariate comparison. A data-driven task {PLS} analysis also showed greater co-activation in an extended network consisting of regions involved in salience detection, attention, and task engagement as a function of increasing target {SES}. This co-activating network was most pronounced for men. These findings provide evidence that high-{SES} targets elicit neural responses indicative of positivity, reward, and salience during impression formation among men. Contributions to a network neuroscience understanding of status perception and implications for gender- and status-based impression formation are discussed.},

We argue that, because vision is primary, trusted, flexible, and effortless, motivated visual perception maintains a unique ability to serve self-regulation. We propose a novel theoretical perspective—Goal-Promoting Perception Theory—and review empirical work from our labs and others’ that suggests motivated perception aids in three aspects of goal pursuit: goal planning, goal striving, and goal shielding. In addition, we articulate avenues for future research and outline testable hypotheses to strengthen the links between motivated perception and self-regulatory outcomes. Ultimately, this chapter draws together two largely distinct fields of study to suggest that people see the world in a biased manner to help them manage and advance goals.},

In each pair, the second face depicted either the same target as the first face, a different target from the same race, or a scrambled face outline. We localized face-selective neural regions via an independent task, and demonstrated that neural activity in the fusiform face area ({FFA}) distinguished different faces only when targets belonged to the perceivers’ racial ingroup (White). By contrast, face-selective cortex did not discriminate between other-race individuals. Moreover, across two studies (total N = 67) perceivers were slower to discriminate between different outgroup members and remembered them to a lesser extent. Together, these results suggest that the outgroup homogeneity effect arises when early-to-mid-level visual processing results in an erroneous overlap of representations of outgroup members.},

Specifically, in two neuroimaging experiments (n = 58), we observed increased activation in brain regions associated with reward processing—including the nucleus accumbens—when perceivers observed information consistent with their social expectations. In two additional behavioral experiments (n = 704), we observed that perceivers were willing to forgo money to encounter an expectation-consistent target and avoid an expectation-violating target.

Across seven studies, we proposed and empirically tested a social task demand hypothesis that social categorization of a particular group of faces occurs in priority along one dimension (race or gender) in response to speciﬁc social task demands. Study 1 showed behavioral evidence that other-race faces are more densely clustered into one category, whereas same-race faces are more distantly separated into two (male and female) categories. Studies 2–4 showed electrophysiological evidence for earlier spontaneous racial categorization of other-race faces but earlier spontaneous gender categorization of same-race faces during an individual face recognition task. Studies 5–7 manipulated social task demands and provided electrophysiological evidence that early processes underlying racial or gender categorization of other-race or same-race faces were inhibited or facilitated by task demands of evaluating gender roles or group membership of perceived faces. Our ﬁndings indicate that the priority of racial or gender categorization of other-race or same-race faces varies dynamically to meet social task demands of managing intergroup and cross-sex interactions.},

	abstract = {Black, relative to White, individuals have experienced discrimination for centuries in the United States. Recent work suggests that subtle differences in how novel Black faces are initially perceived relate to prejudicial behavior. One such difference is that non-Black people attend more to the eyes of White versus Black novel faces. The present study sought to better characterize this difference by assessing how distinct individual differences widely shown to relate to prejudicial behavior—internal motivation to respond without prejudice ({IMS}), external motivation to respond without prejudice ({EMS}), and implicit race bias—relate to disparities in attending to the eyes of novel Black and White faces. Participants viewed novel Black and White faces one at a time on the right or left side of the display. Replicating a race-based disparity in visual attention to the eyes, non-Black perceivers fixated more on the eyes of White in comparison to Black faces. Individual differences among perceivers corresponded with the extent of this race-based disparity. {IMS} had a negative relationship with a race-based disparity in attention to the eyes, such that higher levels of {IMS} among perceivers corresponded with lower disparities in attention. Implicit race bias had a positive relationship with this disparity, such that higher levels of implicit race bias among perceivers corresponded with higher disparities in attention. Together, these findings illustrate that two individual differences known to affect prejudicial behavior are associated with preferential gaze patterns in visual attention toward faces on the basis of race.},

The current study aimed to address this. Participants categorised happy and angry expressions on own- and other-race faces, and male and female faces. In Experiments 1 and 2, holistic processing was disrupted by presenting inverted faces (Experiment 1) or part faces (Experiment 2). In Experiments 3 and 4 participants’ eye-gaze to eye and mouth regions was also tracked. Disrupting holistic processing did not alter the moderating inﬂuence of sex and race cues on emotion recognition (Experiments 1, 2, 4). Gaze patterns diﬀered as a function of emotional expression, and social category cues, however, eye-gaze patterns did not reﬂect response time patterns (Experiments 3 and 4).

          The other-race effect refers to the phenomenon in which the chance of individuals misidentifying faces from other races more than their own race is significantly higher. This study explored the effect of motivation on the other-race effect by manipulating the social status of faces. The results showed that: (1) compared to other-race faces with low social status, when individuals' perceptions of the social status of other-race faces increased, individuals' recognition scores for high social status other-race faces increased, and the other-race effect disappeared, and (2) when individuals' perceptions of the social status of other-race faces decreased, there was no significant difference in individuals' recognition scores of other-race faces, of either high or low social status. These findings suggest that motivation has a significant impact on the other-race effect.},

However, despite processing differences for racial ingroups and outgroups, very little is known about processing of racial ingroup and outgroup members during intergroup contexts. Thus, the present research investigated attention and memory differences for racial ingroup and outgroup members during competition for attention (i.e., intergroup contexts). In experiment 1, event-related potentials ({ERPs}) were obtained while participants completed a working memory task that presented 4 faces (2 Black, 2 White) at once then, following a short delay, were probed to indicate the spatial location of one of the faces. Participants showed better location memory for Black than White faces. During encoding, {ERP} results revealed differences based on the race of the face in P300 amplitudes, such that there was greater motivated processing when attending to Black faces. At probe, the N170 indicated enhanced early processing of Black faces and greater {LPCs} were associated with better recollection of Black face location. In a follow-up study using the same task, we examined attention and working memory biases for Asian and White faces in Caucasian and Asian participants. Results for both Caucasian and Asian participants indicated better working memory for Asian relative to White faces. Together, results indicate that during intergroup contexts, racial minority faces capture attention, resulting in better memory for those faces. The study underscores that examining racial biases with single stimuli paradigms obscures important aspects of attention and memory biases during intergroup contexts.},

With an eye tracker, we measured the effect of this manipulation on attention to the eyes, a critical region for person perception and face memory. In Experiment 1, we monitored the impact of perceived interpersonal similarity on White partici‑pants’ attention to the eyes of same-race White targets. In Experiment 2, we replicated this procedure, but White participants were presented with either same-race White targets or other-race Black targets in a between-subjects design. The pattern of results in both experiments indicated a positive linear effect of similarity—greater perceived similarity between participants and targets predicted more attention to the eyes of White and Black faces.

Therefore, one critical factor for successful social communication is the ability to process faces. In general, a wide body of social cognitive research has demonstrated that perceivers are better at extracting information from their own-­race compared to other-­race faces and that these differences can be a barrier to positive cross-­race relationships. The primary objective of the present paper was to provide an overview of how people process faces in diverse contexts, focusing on racial ingroup and outgroup members within one nation and across nations. To achieve this goal, we first broadly describe social cognitive research on categorization processes related to ingroups vs. outgroups. Next, we briefly examine two prominent mechanisms (experience and motivation) that have been used to explain differences in recognizing facial identities and identifying emotions when processing ingroup and outgroup racial faces within nations. Then, we explore research in this domain across nations and cultural explanations, such as norms and practices, that supplement the two proposed mechanisms. Finally, we propose future cross-­cultural research that has the potential to help us better understand the role of these key mechanisms in processing ingroup and outgroup faces.},

Next, we examined these processes in adults and show different patterns of attention for own and other group faces. Although we briefly consider cross‐cultural variations, the focus of this review is on within‐culture differences in visual attention. In particular, we explore preferential attention to specific features on own versus other group faces and to their overall faces. We also discuss potential determinants for differential attention such as experience, threat, individuation and a desire to know ingroups, and liking. Finally, we explore the implications of differential attention to own and other groups. These consequences range from reduced recognition of other group faces, to impaired identification of emotional expressions, to impeded interaction intentions, and to increased discrimination. Together our analyses provide strong evidence for differences in attention to the faces and eyes of own versus other group members and their role in intergroup biases.},

To directly measure the {ORE}, we used a recognition memory test to measure differences between same- and otherethnicity infant and adult faces. Regardless of age, same-ethnicity faces were better remembered than other-ethnicity faces. Further, regardless of ethnicity, adult faces were better remembered than infant faces, a finding consistent with an Other Age Effect.

	title = {Perceptual Contributions to Racial Bias in Pain Recognition},
	abstract = {The pain of Black Americans is systematically underdiagnosed and undertreated, compared to the pain of their White counterparts. Extensive research has examined the psychological factors that might account for such biases, including status judgments, racial prejudice, and stereotypes about biological differences between Blacks and Whites. Across seven experiments, we accumulated evidence that lower-level perceptual processes also uniquely contribute to downstream racial biases in pain recognition. We repeatedly observed that White participants showed more stringent thresholds for perceiving pain on Black faces, compared to White faces. A tendency to see painful expressions on Black faces less readily arose, in part, from a disruption in configural processing associated with other-race faces. Subsequent analyses revealed that this racial bias in pain perception could not be easily attributed to stimulus features (e.g., color, luminance, or contrast), subjective evaluations related to pain tolerance and experience (e.g., masculinity, dominance, etc.), or objective differences in face structure and expression intensity between Black and White faces. Finally, we observed that racial biases in perception facilitated biases in pain treatment decisions, and that this relationship existed over and above biased judgments of status and strength, explicit racial bias, and endorsement of false beliefs regarding biological differences. A meta-analysis across 9 total experiments (N ϭ 1,289) confirmed the robustness and size of these effects. This research establishes a subtle, albeit influential, perceptual pathway to intergroup bias in pain care and treatment. Implications for racial bias, face perception, and medical treatment are discussed.},

Yet before faces can be recognized, they must first be detected in the visual field. Here, we tested whether humans also show an ingroup bias at the earliest stage of face processing –­the point at which the presence of a face is first detected. To this end, we measured viewers' ability to detect ingroup (Black and White) and outgroup faces (Asian, Black, and White) in everyday scenes. Ingroup faces were detected with greater speed and accuracy relative to outgroup faces (Experiment 1). Removing face hue impaired detection generally, but the ingroup detection advantage was undiminished (Experiment 2). This same pattern was replicated by a detection algorithm using face templates derived from human data (Experiment 3). These findings demonstrate that the established ingroup bias in face processing can extend to the early process of detection. This effect is ‘colour blind’, in the sense that group membership effects are independent of general effects of image hue. Moreover, it can be captured by tuning visual templates to reflect the statistics of observers' social experience. We conclude that group bias in face detection is both a visual and a social phenomenon.},

The first goal of the study was to characterize how participants distribute their attentional resources to a set of faces displayed on a vertical hierarchical scale including three social ranks (high, middle and low). In the first phase of the experiment, participants had to learn a hierarchy based on performance in competitive games. The participants’ rank, the other players’ rank, and the spatial orientation of the scale (highest social rank at the top of the vertical scale vs. highest social rank at the bottom) were manipulated. The results revealed that participants looked more at other players who occupy the highest than the lowest social rank but did not look more at another player who was ranked higher than lower than themselves when that player was in the middle position. Hence, participants were more sensitive to the highest vs. lowest rank contrast than to the higher vs. lower rank contrast. The results also revealed an influence of spatial orientation of the scale: less visual attention was allocated to the highest-ranking players when they appeared at the bottom than at the top of the spatial scale. The second goal of the study was to investigate how participants explored the face of each player. This was addressed in the second phase of the experiment, in which participants were presented with each player’s face individually. The results did not show any effect of players’ rank but revealed that in some circumstances, participants in the higher-ranking position were less likely to allocate visual resources to other players.},

Consistent with previous work on the effect of motivation and interracial contact on other-race face memory, we found that motivation and interracial contact interacted to shape perceivers' accuracy at inferring mental states from secondary emotions. When motivated to attend to the task, high-contact White perceivers were more accurate at inferring both Black and White targets’ mental states; unexpectedly, the opposite was true for low-contact perceivers. Importantly, the target race did not interact with interracial contact, suggesting that contact is associated with
              general

	abstract = {The other-race effect ({ORE}), or the finding that same-race faces are better recognized than other-race faces, is one of the best replicated phenomena in face recognition. The current article reviews existing evidence and theory and proposes a new theoretical framework for the {ORE}, which argues that the effect results from a confluence of social categorization, motivated individuation, and perceptual experience. This categorization-individuation model offers not only a parsimonious account of both classic and recent evidence for category-based biases in face recognition but also links the {ORE} to broader evidence and theory in social cognition and face perception. Finally, the categorization-individuation model makes a series of novel predictions for how the {ORE} can be exacerbated, attenuated, or even eliminated via perceptual and motivational processes, both by improving other-race recognition and by reducing same-race recognition. The authors propose that this new model for the {ORE} also leads to applied interventions that differ sharply from other theories of the {ORE}, while simultaneously providing an integrative theoretical framework for future research on the {ORE}.},

In contrast with earlier {EEG} studies that typically manipulate social rank through competitive situations, we implemented hierarchy through occupational status and thus contrasted faces associated with high- vs. low-status (e.g. lawyer vs. waiter). Since social hierarchies are largely intertwined with gender, both female and male faces were used as stimuli, and both female and male participants were tested. The procedure consisted in presenting a status label before the face it was associated with. The analyses focused mainly on two components that have been shown to be modulated by competitive hierarchies and other social contexts, namely the N170 and the Late Positive Potential ({LPP}). The results indicated that gender, but not status, modulated the N170 amplitude. Moreover, high-status faces elicited larger {LPP} amplitude than low-status faces but this diﬀerence was driven by female participants. This gender eﬀect is discussed in line with research showing that women and men are sensitive to diﬀerent kinds of hierarchy. Methodological diﬀerences are considered to account for the discrepancy between studies that ﬁnd an eﬀect of hierarchy on the N170 and those that do not.},

Finally, Experiment 3 finds that high-status faces received more expertstyle holistic processing than did low-status faces. This suggests that high-status faces also benefit more from the strategic deployment of expert face processing resources than low-status faces. Taken together, these data indicate that perceivers strategically allocate face processing resources to targets perceived to be high in status.},

In four studies, the authors tested whether implicit and explicit status perceptions are influenced by pride and shame expressions even when these expressions’ status-related messages are contradicted by contextual information. Results indicate that emotion expressions powerfully influence implicit and explicit status inferences, at times neutralizing or even overriding situational knowledge.These findings demonstrate the irrepressible communicative power of emotion displays and indicate that status judgments can be informed as much (and often more) by automatic responses to nonverbal expressions of emotion as by rational, contextually bound knowledge.},

	abstract = {It is commonly believed that race is perceived through another’s facial features, such as skin color. In the present research, we demonstrate that cues to social status that often surround a face systematically change the perception of its race. Participants categorized the race of faces that varied along White–Black morph continua and that were presented with highstatus or low-status attire. Low-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as Black, whereas high-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as White; and this influence grew stronger as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 1). When faces with high-status attire were categorized as Black or faces with low-status attire were categorized as White, participants’ hand movements nevertheless revealed a simultaneous attraction to select the other race-category response (stereotypically tied to the status cue) before arriving at a final categorization. Further, this attraction effect grew as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 2). Computational simulations then demonstrated that these effects may be accounted for by a neurally plausible person categorization system, in which contextual cues come to trigger stereotypes that in turn influence race perception. Together, the findings show how stereotypes interact with physical cues to shape person categorization, and suggest that social and contextual factors guide the perception of race.},

Wearing upper-class, compared to lower-class, clothing induced dominance—measured in terms of negotiation profits and concessions, and testosterone levels—in participants. Upper-class clothing also elicited increased vigilance in perceivers of these symbols: Relative to perceiving lower-class symbols, perceiving upper-class symbols increased vagal withdrawal, reduced perceptions of social power, and catalyzed physiological contagion such that perceivers’ sympathetic nervous system activation followed that of the upper-class target. Discussion focuses on the dyadic process of social class signaling within social interactions.},

To what degree category bias develops when learning goals emphasize individuation of each stimulus and whether the bias emerges spontaneously during learning itself rather than in response to task demands is unclear. Here, we used functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) during encoding to test for category biases in neural representations of individual stimuli during learning. Human participants (males and females) encountered face-blend stimuli with unique first names and shared family names that indicated category membership. Participants were instructed to learn the full name for each face. Neural pattern classification and pattern similarity analyses were used to track category information in the brain. Results showed that stimulus category could be decoded during encoding across many frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Furthermore, two stimuli from the same category were represented more similarly in the prefrontal cortex than two stimuli from different categories equated for physical similarity. These findings illustrate that a mere presence of category label can bias neural representations spontaneously during encoding to emphasize category-relevant information, even in the absence of explicit categorization demands and when category-irrelevant information remains relevant for task goals.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              Entities belonging to the same category are perceived as being more similar than entities belonging to different categories. Here, we show that neural representations highlighting category-relevant information form spontaneously during encoding. Notably, the presence of a category label led to neural category bias although participants focused on remembering individual stimuli and category-irrelevant stimulus features remained important for explicit task goals. These results may inform our understanding of bias in general and suggest that bias may emerge when category information is present even when one's explicit focus is on individuals.},

We tested this with an archival study comparing the extent to which titles of over 5,000 published psychology articles specify samples’ racial/ethnic/national/cultural characteristics—a practice that implies constraints to generalizability. We observed that samples from the United States were less frequently specified in titles compared to both other {WEIRD} and non-{WEIRD} regions. Yet, samples from the United States (compared to other regions) were more frequently specified in titles if they referred to racial/ethnic/cultural minorities who may be perceived as exceptions to assumed generalizability of the White American population. These findings suggest that one consequence of a {USA}-centric sampling bias in psychology may be biased assumptions of (White) people from the United States as especially reflective of humankind.},

This feature allows {LMMs} to address some of the problems identiﬁed by Speelman and {McGann} (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using {LMM} to analyse skewed reaction time ({RT}) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw {RT} produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identiﬁcation, which conﬂicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed {RT}. Generalized linear mixed-effect models ({GLMM}) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher’s theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a {GLMM}, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.’s datasets. We then consider the broader beneﬁts of using {GLMM} to investigate individual differences.},

	abstract = {The theory of planned behavior ({TPB}) allows researchers to identify the determinants of environmental behavior and subsequently target these factors in interventions. Multiple studies on conservation behaviors have recently applied this theoretical framework in both organizational and domestic settings. To shed more light on how the {TPB} was used in these studies, we conducted a literature review with the following objectives: 1) explore which individual green behaviors were studied though the lens of the {TPB}, 2) understand how scholars have used the theory and what variance the theory has helped to explain, and 3) formulate recommendations, if necessary, for improving the use of the theory. The review of the results from 126 publications demonstrated that the majority of scholars tend to overlook the importance of identifying and evaluating indirect variables (beliefs) that affect behaviors. More than half of the analyzed articles did not report the amount of explained variance, which undermines the principal strength of the theory. Scholars could obtain more substantial and consistent results if the guidelines regarding the application of the theory are consistently respected. More specifically, four aspects should be considered in the application of the theory: choice of framework, decision to extend the original model, methodology, and results. To help scholars overcome these commonly encountered problems, this article suggests a roadmap with several guiding questions and possible answers.},

	abstract = {Abstract The recent exchange about implicit attitudes is an acute reminder of the need to pay research attention to the correlation between implicit attitudes and overt behavior. Current implicit measures are excellent to detect evaluatively relevant associations arising from specific and variable internal states and predict judgments when people lack the motivation and ability to control those judgments. However, there is no convincing evidence of a strong correlation between such implicit attitudes and overt behavior when people's ability and motivation to control the influence of these attitudes is low. Researchers should improve implicit measures by better integrating action, target, level, and context into the measurement procedures and then reexamine if these improved measures predict socially undesirable behaviors when ability and motivation to control behavior are low.

In Study 1, we demonstrated the validity of the adopted measure (i.e., the {IAT}; Greenwald, {McGhee}, \& Schwartz, 1998) with a sample of voters who clearly sided with one of the opposing parties. In Study 2, implicit political preferences were measured in a sample of undecided voters one month before the election, and actual voting behavior was assessed immediately after the election. Results demonstrated that implicit political attitudes were good predictors of future voting behaviors. These findings support the hypothesis of the presence of embryonic attitudes even in the case of those voters who at the explicit and conscious level deny any preference for one of the two opposing candidates.},

            Previous surveys of the literature have shown that reports of statistical analyses often lack important information, causing lack of transparency and failure of reproducibility. Editors and authors agree that guidelines for reporting should be encouraged. This Review presents a set of Bayesian analysis reporting guidelines ({BARG}). The {BARG} encompass the features of previous guidelines, while including many additional details for contemporary Bayesian analyses, with explanations. An extensive example of applying the {BARG} is presented. The {BARG} should be useful to researchers, authors, reviewers, editors, educators and students. Utilization, endorsement and promotion of the {BARG} may improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of Bayesian analyses.},
