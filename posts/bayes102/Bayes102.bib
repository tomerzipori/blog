	abstract = {This Tutorial explains the statistical concept known as likelihood and discusses how it underlies common frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods. The article is suitable for researchers interested in understanding the basis of their statistical tools and is also intended as a resource for teachers to use in their classrooms to introduce the topic to students at a conceptual level.},
