<p>OK, but what is AI <em>actually</em> about? Over the past two summers, I taught a statistics and research methods course to psychology students. Generally speaking, these students tend to be a little intimidated by this field, and as always, I tried over the summer to both empower them and spark an interest in them in the beauty and ‘coolness’ of statistics.</p>
<p>One idea they liked was when I told them: <em>If you understand linear regression, you understand Chat GPT</em>. While this is obviously a simplification, I managed to convince them it is not far from the truth. If simple linear modeling is about finding the best two parameters (a slope and an intercept) to approximate a function, AI is about finding the best millions to billions of parameters to approximate a function. In this blog post I will explain one of the basic and most important concepts of modern AI - <strong>Gradient Descent</strong> using simple (as possible) terms and some R code.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between the variables <em>Time Spent Studying</em> and <em>Final Grade</em>?</p>
<p>The mission of every statistical model is to provide the best function to estimate this relationship. The function can be linear:</p>

<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://tomerzipori.github.io/blog/posts/micrograd/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>

</div>

<p>It can also be quadratic:</p>

<p>And even a fifth degree polynomial:</p>

<p>Which is the best? In order to answer this question, we need to define what we want our model to maximize (or minimize). Usually, two main things are considered when evaluating our fitted lines: 1. Distance from truth, or how close the line (predictions) is to the points. 2. Complexity, or how complex is the function.</p>
<p>Together, these two components create the <strong>Loss</strong> that will always look conceptually like that:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ALoss=distance-complexity%0A"></p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity (no pun intended), and because both simple linear regression and deep neural networks share this feature, we will ignore the complexity component of the Loss function. So what is the distance between the line and the points for the linear function?</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>Each gray dotted line represents the difference between the actual outcome (Final Grade) and the model’s prediction based on Time Spent Studying. In a more formal way we say that each line is:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ay_i-%5Chat%7By_i%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Where:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i"> is the real outcome of point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"><br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7By_i%7D"> is the predicted outcome of point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"></p>
<p>And the total loss can be the mean of these lines:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7BN%7D(y_i-%5Chat%7By_i%7D)%0A"></p>
<p>BUT, this definition is problematic as I will show in the next chapter.</p>
<section id="optimal-minimum-loss-intro-to-loss-functions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimal-minimum-loss-intro-to-loss-functions">Optimal = Minimum loss (intro to loss functions)</h2>
<p>Now we can calculate the loss for every model we fit, therefore the loss is actually a function of the model and is called the <strong>Loss Function</strong>.</p>

<p>Models can differ in two main ways: in their structure (for example: a linear function and a 5-th degree polynomial), or in the values of their parameters (for example: these two linear functions: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y=2x-4">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y=3x+5">). With the model structure usually chosen a-priori (or through a separate experiment), we will focus on the loss as a function of the parameters’ values.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So our task is to find the set of parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> that minimize the loss function. Let’s formalize it for the linear model case: Given a linear model: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7By%7D=%5Cbeta_0+%5Cbeta_1x">, our goal is to find the minimum of:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aloss(%5Cbeta_0,%5Cbeta_1)=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7BN%7D(y_i-%5Cbeta_0-%5Cbeta_1x_i)%0A"></p>
<p>But, there is the catch - this function does not have a minimum point! This is because the lines we saw before can be as negative as we want, just make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_0"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_1"> negative enough. We can also notice that this function is linear with respect to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_0"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta1">, therefore it has no minimum or maximum points.</p>
<p>In order to solve this, we simply define the loss function to be the mean <strong>Square</strong> distance from the line - also known as the Variance.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aloss(%5Cbeta_0,%5Cbeta_1)=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7BN%7D(y_i-%5Chat%7By_i%7D)%5E2=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7BN%7D(y_i-%5Cbeta_0-%5Cbeta_1x_i)%5E2%0A"></p>

<p>Now let’s find the minimum point using a more rigorous way.</p>
<section id="derivatives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="derivatives">Derivatives</h2>
<p>The derivative of a function (with respect to some variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">) at some point is <strong>the slope of the tangent line to the function at this point</strong>, In other words, how much the function “goes up (or down)” at this point.</p>
<p>Consider this simple function:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>As expected and as we can see in the graph, this derivative is negative.</p>
<p>Why do we care? imagine that we stand on the point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x=6"> and we want to “go up”, in what direction we should advance? If the function is increasing at this point - The derivative is positive - then we want to go right (increase <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">). But, if the function is decreasing at this point - The derivative is negative - then we want to go left (decrease <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">). Notice that in both scenarios we want to go <strong>In the direction of the derivative</strong>.</p>
<p>So, what if we stand on the point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x=6"> and we want to “go down”? Simple, just go <strong>In the opposite direction of the derivative</strong>! Let’s see how that works:</p>

<p>And this is <em>Stochastic Gradient Descent</em> (SGD) - Descending down the gradient (derivative) in a loop (in a stochastic manner).</p>
<p>What about multivariate functions? for example: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x_1,%20x_2)=3x_1-4x_2+x_1x_2-5">. In this case we can calculate the derivative of each variable with respect to the outcome, also called the partial derivatives: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20y%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20x_1%7D,%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20y%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20x_2%7D%0A"></p>
<p>For example, let’s calculate the partial derivative of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> with respect to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> in the point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1=-2,%20x_2=3">:</p>

<p>The partial derivative of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1"> at the point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1=-2,%20x_2=3"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?6">. Now we just need to calculate the partial derivative of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_2"> at the same point and descend the gradient!</p>

<p>Returning to the case of a simple linear regression, we see that the whole thing is just about some function with two parameters that we need to minimize.</p>

<p>Let’s estimate the partial derivatives of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_0"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_1"> with respect to the loss at the point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_0=2,%20%5Cbeta_1=0.5">:</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the current post we went over the basic idea underlying all of AI. Every part of the process built here was further developed and improved, most important the algorithms used to descend the gradient, but also other things, for example: the specific way of initializing the parameters and adaptive learning rates.</p>
<p>I hope this post was interesting, and like my Psychology students, you fill like you understand AI a little bit more after it. I hope to post more in the future about other things related to AI, and maybe LLM’s, inspired by my latest deep dive into them.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Ever since I’ve finished my grad studies (Few months ago), I wanted to experiment with some “real life” applications of statistics. Things that interest real people. With the 2024 American presidential elections being the hot issue around the world, and Bayesian statistics being the hot issue of my personal projects, I thought how can these two mix.</p>
<p>Two features of Bayesian statistics pop to mind when thinking about election polling:</p>
<section id="prior-distributions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prior-distributions">Prior Distributions</h2>
<p>The need to explicitly define a prior distribution for any Bayesian model is a point of contention. Some (rightfully) argue that this definition can’t be objective, and it is practically impossible to represent the existing body of knowledge in a single probability distribution. Others (rightfully) argue that every statistical model have prior assumptions which are rarely checked, and can influence the model as much as a prior distribution.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>One reason the incorporation of past studies into the prior distribution is hard, is that it depends on the specific parameters of the model. While this make things hard in many cases, election polling is one area where it should be relatively easy! every poll is essentially the same statistical model (how many votes for red, and how many votes for blue), but with different data every time. This is the ideal scenario for a Bayesian statistician as the posterior distribution (the result) of any poll can be used as the prior distribution for the next poll!</p>
</section>
<section id="posterior-predictive-distributions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="posterior-predictive-distributions">Posterior Predictive Distributions</h2>
<p>One tool of Bayesian statistical inference is the Posterior Predictive Distributions - PPD. This is the prediction of the model. For example, one possible PPD from a Bayesian election poll could be the expected electoral college result for each candidate, or the expected number of seats in the parliament.</p>

<h1>Modeling</h1>
<p>From a statistical point of view, an election poll is a multiclass classification problem: It estimates the real proportion of votes for each candidate in the population, from the sampled proportions. The dependent variable is categorical and does not have any ordering. Since we don’t have any predictors other than the observed proportions, the model is what is called an <em>empty</em> model - and it’s formulation in <code>R</code> is usually represented as: <code>DV ~ 1</code>. Due to the structure of the current data, each observation (row) need to be weighted by the observed percentage. In order to include weighting by the poll’s sample size, I multiplied this percentage by the sample size.</p>
<p>This multiclass classification problem can be represented with a series of logistic models, each models one category (candidate) against the others as a binary outcome. In order to do that, I will use the <code>categorical()</code> family implemented in <code>brms</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple case, and model results only for Nevada:</p>

<p>A few things to notice here: first, Trump doesn’t have a parameter. That is because <code>brms</code> estimates each parameter in comparison to the factor’s reference level, which is set to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0">, or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> on the exponential scale. Second, parameter estimates are logits, as this is essentially an output of multiple logistic regressions. In order to transform these estimates into predicted vote shares for every candidate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> out of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> total candidates, a softmax transformation need to be applied:</p>

<p>Again, very close (with a slight advantage to Harris).</p>
<p>Another useful measure from Bayesian statistics is the probability of direction (pd). Due to the winner-takes-all electoral system in 48 of the 50 states, the difference doesn’t really matter. So what is the probability that each candidate will win?</p>
<p>The probability that Trump will win is seen in the red area in the plot above, that is the probability that the difference in vote share is positive:</p>

<p>These percentages need to be transformed to the logistic model’s scale, now using the inverse-softmax transformation:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A0.5006=softmax(Intercept_%7BHarris%7D)=%5Cfrac%7Be%5E%7BIntercept_%7BHarris%7D%7D%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5EK%20e%5E%7BIntercept_k%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A0.4767=softmax(Intercept_%7BTrump%7D)=%5Cfrac%7Be%5E%7BIntercept_%7BTrump%7D%7D%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5EK%20e%5E%7BIntercept_k%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>But with Trump’s intercept fixed to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> as the factor’s reference level, it’s possible to calculate the sum in the denominator:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A0.4767=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5EK%20e%5E%7BIntercept_k%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Quick algebra gives:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5EK%20e%5E%7BIntercept_k%7D=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B0.4767%7D=2.097755%0A"></p>
<p>Now it’s possible to calculate Harris’ intercept:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A0.5006=%5Cfrac%7Be%5E%7BIntercept_%7BHarris%7D%7D%7D%7B2.097755%7D%0A"></p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ae%5E%7BIntercept_%7BHarris%7D%7D=0.5006%20%5Ccdot%202.097755=1.050136%0A"></p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AIntercept_%7BHarris%7D=ln(1.050136)=0.04891968%0A"></p>
<p>A quicker way to derive these intercepts is to notice that for every candidate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> other than the ‘reference’ candidate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">, the intercept is:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AIntercept_j=ln(%5Cfrac%7BP(j)%7D%7BP(r)%7D)%0A"></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(j)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(r)"> are the assumed vote shares of candidate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r"> respectively.</p>

<h1>Running models for all states</h1>
<p>In this section I run the same Bayesian model for each state. The better way of doing it will be to run one big model with <code>state</code> as a categorical predictor.<sup>2</sup> This one-big-model method didn’t converge on the current data, so I resort to run a separate model for each state.</p>
<p>Here I define some functions to run on the list of states:</p>

<p>Of course there are a lot more interesting calculations and visualizations that can be derived from the current Bayesian model, and from other models. This is a first attempt at implementing Bayesian statistical methods in the election polling field, I had fun.</p>

<p>This is the second part of “Bayesian modeling for Psychologists”, see part 1 <a href="https://tomerzipori.github.io/blog/posts/bayes101/">here</a>. In this post I will show how to model some more complicated regression models, more similar to the ones you will fit in you research.</p>

<p>We get the following model:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0APetal.Length=1.33+0.55%20%5Ccdot%20Petal.Width+0.45%20%5Ccdot%20SpeciesVersicolor+2.91%20%5Ccdot%20SpeciesVirginica+1.32%20%5Ccdot%20Petal.Width%20%5Ccdot%20SpeciesVersicolor+0.1%20%5Ccdot%20Petal.Width%20%5Ccdot%20SpeciesVirginica%0A"></p>
<p>In order for the intercept to have practical meaning we need to center the predictor <code>Petal.Width</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1">iris<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;

font-style: inherit;">1</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Fitting the model again:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1">ols_model_centered <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;

</div>
<p>Now the intercept will be the predicted <code>Petal.Length</code> for Setosa flowers with mean <code>Petal.Width</code>:</p>

<p>In order to fit the same model in a Bayesian way, we will first need to define the prior distribution. In this case there are a total of 7 parameters.</p>

<p>I will model some positive relationship between <em>length</em> and <em>width</em>, a relatively weakly-informed prior on the intercept, and a very wide prior on the not-interesting sigma parameter. On the other parameters I will have an “agnostic” zero-centered Normal distribution:</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><section id="student-t-prior" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="student-t-prior">student-t prior</h4>
<p>The student-t distribution is symmetrical like the Gaussian distribution, but it has thicker “tails”. This allows the model to explore wider area of the possible parameter value space.</p>

<p>Marginal posteriors are nice, but are not a visualization of the model itself. Like in the frequentist model, we would like to see the regression line itself. How to do it?</p>
<p>The regression line is a line of conditional means:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmu%7CX=%5Cbeta%20X%0A">/</p>
<p>But, we have 4000 samples from the posterior containing possible values for each parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_i"> - a.k.a a distribution. So for each possible row in the data set we will have a distribution (4000 values) of predicted conditional means <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu%7CX">:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h4>
<p>Why not summarizing the MCMC chains when inferring or visualizing a Bayesian model?</p>
<p>A key aspect of statistical modeling and visualization is the measurement of uncertainty in the data. In the frequentist world, this is represented with standard errors and confidence intervals.</p>
<p>In the Bayesian world uncertainty is represented by the MCMC samples themselves, creating the posterior distribution. For that reason we will make calculations and visualizations with the MCMC samples and not with their summaries.</p>

<p>This is similar to the frequentist confidence interval, just remember that these interval <strong>actually</strong> represents 80%, 85%, and 97% of regression lines.</p>
<p>I think that a better way of visualizing uncertainty is by plotting the individual line themselves. Each draw represents a different regression line, plotting them all will give a nice uncertainty visualization:</p>

<h1>Hierarchical Linear Models (Mixed Effects Linear Models)</h1>
<p>Hierarchical linear regression models, or Mixed effects linear models are very popular in Psychology due to the fact that data in the field tends to be hierarchical (e.g.&nbsp;repeated measures of participants, participants nested in some larger groups, etc…). Because this post is already quite long, I will assume you have some knowledge about hierarchical structure, fixed and random effects and model estimation.<br>
</p>
<p>Luckily for us, <code>brms</code> is more then capable at estimating mixed effects models. It even has the <code>lme4</code>/<code>nlme</code> syntax in the logo!</p>

<p>As our models get more complicated, the posterior distribution gets more hard for the MCMC sampler to sample from. That can result in low ECC and/or high Rhat. One solution can be simply increasing the length of each MCMC chain! this change to model definition doesn’t require compiling the <em>Stan</em> code again, use the <code>update()</code> function instead:</p>

<p>Often, our interesting research questions demand yet more complex models. Recall that ordinary regression model assumes that the dependent variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> is following a normal distribution with conditional mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_0+%5Cbeta_1%20x_1+...+%5Cbeta_n%20x_n"> and variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2">. Generalized linear models can assume other distributions for the outcome variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">, for example: if our outcome is binary we can assume it follows a Bernoulli distribution: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20%5Csim%20Bernoulli(p)">. In this kind of model the parameter that is modeled is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">.</p>
<p>In part 1 we called this the assumption of a Data Generating Process (DGP).</p>

<section id="link-function" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="link-function">Link Function</h3>
<p>Sometimes modeling other parameters creates other complexities: for example: the parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> is a probability, strictly bounded in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B0;1%5D">, but the linear predictor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_0+%5Cbeta_1%20x_1+...+%5Cbeta_n%20x_n"> should be allowed to be any value in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B-%5Cinfty;+%5Cinfty%5D">. Somehow, the parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> should be mapped from it’s <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B0;1%5D"> interval to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B-%5Cinfty;+%5Cinfty%5D"> interval. This is done with a <em>Link Function</em>:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Af(p)=%5Cbeta_0+%5Cbeta_1%20x_1+...+%5Cbeta_n%20x_n%0A"></p>
<p>For Bernoulli models this link function if often the <em>logit</em> function: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?logit(p)=ln(%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B1-p%7D)"> - giving Logistic regression it’s name.</p>
<p>The term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(p)"> is often not easy or intuitive for interpretation, so the equation will be back-transformed<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<p>When the market doesn’t change - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Lag1=0">, the probability of the market going Up is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.08"> greater then the probability of it going down. The market tends to go up!</p>
<p>And, for an increase in one unit of <code>Lag1</code>, the odds ratio <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%20%7Bp(Direction=Up)%7D%7Bp(Direction=Down)%7D"> decreases by a factor of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.93">. Let’s estimate the posterior!</p>

<p>Let’s guess that a positive return yesterday predicts a positive return today. Meaning a coefficient greater then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> for <code>Lag1</code>. If the odds ratio is greater then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, the log-odds ratio is greater then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ln(1)=0">. Furthermore, the overall direction of the stock market is positive, therefore the intercept should also be greater then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">. We define a normal marginal prior with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu=1;%20%5Csigma=3"> for each parameter:</p>

<p>The dataset contains information about patients in a randomized study for epilepsy treatment. Each patient’s number of seizures was recorded 4 times during a 8-week period. We will try to predict the number of seizures from session number (should decrease overtime), and the experimental group (0 = control, 1 = Treatment).</p>
<p>Because the response variable in this case is the count of seizures, we will fit a <em>Poisson</em> model. In this model the estimated parameter is the rate of the Poisson process - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda">.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this post I covered the types of statistical models most popular in Psychology research today, and the Bayesian way of fitting them. Together with part 1, these posts should help you include Bayesian models in your research, and make your results more robust, interesting, and ✨ pretty ✨</p>
<p>The next (and last?) part will be shorter and cover yet more advanced things like model performance, model comparison, prior predictive distributions and more.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>You ran your experiment, collected the data, figured out how to download it in a normal form, and even cleaned and pre-processed it! All this for one simple linear regression model? In the current post I introduce the Bayesian approach for statistical modeling and inference, that can enrich your paper or thesis, and tell new stories using you data. The current post is by no means a full technical/theoretical/mathematical summary of Bayesian statistics and modeling. It’s main purpose is to make things as simple and smooth for students who want to learn some new statistical analysis methods.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Dependent on the stage you are in your academic career in Psychology, you are probably quite familiar with what I will refer to as <em>Frequentist</em> inferential statistics. The underlying assumption of these models is that <em>probability is relative frequency at infinity</em>. Every statistical test is conducted under the assumption of a particular world (the Null-Hypothesis).<br>
In my opinion, this way of inference is intuitive to us only because we are so used to it. I argue that in the real world we update our knowledge in a different way. We assign <em>degrees of belief</em> to different possible hypotheses (worlds) - some worlds are more probable than others. When data is observed, it is used to <em>update</em> our beliefs, and make some possible worlds more probable, and others less probable.</p>
<p>The Bayesian interpretation of probability as degree of belief stands at the foundation of Bayesian statistical modeling (duh). We first assign probability to all possible worlds, than we observe the data, combining them together and update our beliefs.</p>
<section id="bayes-theorem" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bayes-theorem">Bayes theorem</h2>
<section id="discrete-events" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discrete-events">Discrete events</h3>
<p>So what is <em>Bayesian</em> about Bayesian statistics? going back to <em>Intro to statistics</em> in your BA, you learned to derive the Bayes theorem in probability: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP(A%7CB)=%5Cfrac%7BP(B%7CA)%20%5Ccdot%20P(A)%7D%7BP(B)%7D%0A"></p>
<p>In plain words: the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> conditional on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> is equal to the product of the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> conditional on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and the prior probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, divided by the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">. The Bayes theorem gives a rigorous and mathematically defined way of updating beliefs in face of observed data. Sounds familiar? it should! this is exactly what you are doing (or at least want to do) in your thesis/research! you observe some <em>Data</em> and try to learn from it about the <em>World</em>. In your case, World = some statistical model = some set of parameters.<sup>1</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="probability-distributions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="probability-distributions">Probability Distributions</h3>
<p>So what is the probability of your hypothesized set of parameters given the data you observed? Replacing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> with your set of parameters, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> with the observed data we get:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP(Parameters%7CData)=%5Cfrac%7BP(Data%7CParameters)%20%5Ccdot%20P(Parameters)%7D%7BP(Data)%7D%0A"></p>
<p>One thing that we need to remember is almost all<sup>2</sup> of the terms above are no longer single probability values, but continuous probability <em>distributions</em>. For example, the term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Parameters)"> is a probability density distribution in which each possible combination of values of your parameters is assigned a probability.</p>
<p>Each of the terms above has an important role in the world of Bayesian modeling.</p>
</section>
<section id="likelihood" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="likelihood">Likelihood</h3>
<p>The term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Data%7CParameters)"> describes the <em>likelihood</em> of the observed data under different sets of parameter values. In order to keep things simple I will not delve deeper into the theoretical aspects of likelihood (see <span class="citation" data-cites="etz_introduction_2018">Etz (2018)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="pawitan_all_2001">Pawitan (2001)</span>). The main things that are important to know as researchers about the likelihood function is that you are responsible to choosing it! For example, if I suspect that my dependent variable comes from a normal distribution (where you otherwise would fit some sort of linear model), I will use the normal likelihood function<sup>3</sup>:</p>

<p>In general, you need to define the <em>Data Generating Process (DGP)</em> - How were your observations generated?<br>
This choice is analogous to the choice of statistical model/test in the frequentist paradigm. A linear model (t-test, ANOVA, linear regression) assumes a normal DGP, a Generalized linear model assumes some other DGP like a Binomial, Poisson, Inverse Gaussian etc.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prior">Prior</h3>
<p>The next term - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Parameters)"> is called the <em>Prior</em> probability distribution. This term represents the prior knowledge about the parameters in your model. Choosing a prior, a process that is sometime called <em>prior elicitation</em>, is difficult. How can one take into account all prior knowledge about something and neatly represent it with one probability distribution?? For this reason I will refer to 2 relatively-easy-to-define aspects of prior elicitation:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Range of possible/probable parameter values</em> - Some parameters can only take certain values, creating a-priori hard limits for their value. For example, a normal distribution’s variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2"> can only take positive values. Softer limits can also exist, for example: in a new/old recognition task, it is reasonable to predict that new items will be identified as new, more than old items - the regression coefficient should be positive. In the first case, a prior with hard boundary will be appropriate:</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evidence">Evidence</h3>
<p>The denominator in Bayes’ theorem - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Data)"> is called the evidence. It’s important role is to act as the <em>standardizing</em> term to the numerator (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Likelihood%20%5Ccdot%20Prior">). Recall that the likelihood is not a probability distribution, so in order for it’s product with the Prior - a probability distribution - to be equal to the Posterior - another probability distribution - a standardizing term is needed. This term is often impossible to calculate analytically, and therefore fancy numeric estimations are used.<sup>4</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="posterior" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="posterior">Posterior</h3>
<p>The posterior probability of your model - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Parameters%7CData)"> - is the ultimate goal of your analysis. This probability distribution tells you what values of your parameters are probable and what values not so much. This is a shift of perspective from the usual frequentist logic - instead of resulting in one number as estimate for your parameter, you end up with a whole distribution!<br>

<p>All of the examples above refer to estimation of one parameter. Often, your models will include several parameters (100’s if you include random effects). So how does it work?<br>
without getting into detail, know that the simple one-parameter case scales quite nicely into <em>n</em>-parameter models. For example, instead of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(%5Ctheta)"> prior from before, you can have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(%5Ctheta_0,%20%5Ctheta_1,...,%5Ctheta_n)"> prior. A prior of an intercept and a slope for a simple regression model could look like this:</p>

<h1>Bayesian Modeling - How to do it?</h1>
<p>How to actually estimate the posterior probability of our parameters? As we seen before, we will need to define a prior for all parameters, we will need to choose the likelihood function, and we will need to calculate that annoying evidence in the denominator.<br>
</p>
<p>All of this made easy with the amazing <code>brms</code> package (<span class="citation" data-cites="burkner_brms_2017">Bürkner (2017)</span>).</p>

<p><code>brms</code> is actually translating your <code>R</code> code into <em>Stan</em> (<span class="citation" data-cites="stan_development_team_stan_2018">Stan Development Team (2018)</span>), a programming language that is specialized in estimating posterior distributions. Therefore, you will also need to install some sort of <em>backend</em>. Using <code>cmdstanr</code> is probably optimal, but because it’s installation can be tricky, <code>Rstan</code> is another option.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prior-elicitation">Prior elicitation</h2>
<p>How many parameters are there?<br>
1. Intercept - Representing the value of <code>Bwt</code> when the IV is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0">. Meaning it is the estimated mean weight of female cats.<br>
2. Slope of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SexMale"> - Estimated difference in body weight between male and female cats.<br>
3. Sigma - The variance of the residuals (variance of the conditional-mean normal distribution of <code>Bwt</code>).<br>
</p>
<p>What prior knowledge can we incorporate into each parameter?<br>
1. average weight of female cats should probably be ~2Kg-3Kg.<br>
2. Male cats should probably weight more than female cats.<br>
3. The sigma is not so interesting, so I will just define a wide prior.<br>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Recall that because of the annoying Bayes’ denominator (<em>Evidence</em> - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(Data)">) estimating the posterior is usually quite tricky. For that reason it is done with an algorithm called MCMC sampling (Monte Carlo Markov Chain), that samples numbers from the posterior distribution. The posterior estimated is therefore just a list of numbers (a Markov Chain) sampled from the posterior. <em>Diagnostics</em> - MCMC samples tend to be auto-correlated (further read <span class="citation" data-cites="kruschke_markov_2014">Kruschke (2014)</span>, chapter 7), and therefore convey less information about the distribution than an independent sample. The actual sample size of the MCMC algorithm ‘is worth’ less than an independent sample size.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effective Sample Size (ESS)</em> represents the independent sample size roughly equivalent to your MCMC sample size, and is calculated as:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AESS=%5Cfrac%7BN%7D%7B%5Chat%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D%0A"> Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Ctau%7D"> is a measure of chain auto-correlation (with a minimum value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">). It is recommended to get at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ESS%3E1000">.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Chain mixing (R-hat)</em> - when sampling more than two chains or more (most of the times), we will want to check if all of them converge to the same distribution. This is measured with the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7BR%7D"> measure (<span class="citation" data-cites="vehtari_rank-normalization_2021">Vehtari et al.

<p>Notice the values most probable in the posterior are in the range of our hypothesis, and also in the range of the frequentist model. Some calculations that can be done on the posterior include:</p>
<section id="probability-of-direction" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="probability-of-direction">Probability of direction</h5>
<p>How much of the posterior is negative/positive? The answer to this question gives the probability that the parameter is different from zero:</p>

<p>A common misconception of the frequentist’s confidence interval (with 95% credibility) is that it has a 95% probability of containing the true value of the parameter. The Bayesian Highest Density Interval however gives exactly this. The main 95% of the posterior have a 95% probability of containing the real value of the parameter. 95% are obviously arbitrary, and can be defined to anything else:</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This post is just a brief introduction of Bayesian statistical modeling. For those psychology students who want to enrich their statistical analyses, it should provide the basic tools and intuition. This post will be followed up with a deeper dive in to more complex models (multiple linear models, mixed-effects linear models, generalized linear models, ordinal regression models…).</p>

  <title>Rejecting the null hypothesis or not?</title>
  <dc:creator>Tomer Zipori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://tomerzipori.github.io/blog/posts/p_values_paradox/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In the current post I try to explain what appears to be a paradox: given identical data, different schools of statistics disagree about the appropriate conclusion.</p>
<p>Traditionally, there are two ways to interpret Probability:<br>
1. Probability is the relative frequency of events at infinity - the Frequentist school.<br>
2. Probability represents the degree of beliefs - The Bayesian school.</p>
<p>Classic hypothesis testing in the social sciences usually follows the Frequentist school, the probability of errors is calculated as the relative frequency of extreme data under the relevant hypotheses.</p>
<section id="distribution-of-p-values-when-the-null-hypothesis-is-true" class="level1">
<h1>Distribution of p-values when the null hypothesis is true</h1>
<p>An example for Frequentist logic in hypothesis testing is the probability of type I errors, also known as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha">: rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.</p>
<p>The famous (and notorious?) 5% convention, refers to the relative frequency of significant tests when the null is true.</p>
<p>Let’s take infinite (140,000) samples of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=30"> from populations with equal means, and compare each of them with a t-test:</p>

<h1>Distribution of p-values when the null hypothesis is false</h1>
<p>What happens when population means are <em>not</em> equal? The probability of detecting an existing effect (e.g.&nbsp;getting a significant result) is called <em>Power</em>. Naturally, statistical Power is larger for larger differences between populations means.</p>

<figcaption>All about the Bayes</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As we said before, p-values represent the probability of getting certain data when the null hypothesis is true. What if we looked at it from the other side? What is the probability that the null hypothesis is true, given a certain p-value?</p>
<p>In the Frequentist school, this question seems weird: what is the relative frequency at infinity of the null hypothesis being true? That is, out of infinite worlds, in how many of them the null is true?</p>
<p>Switching our perspective to be Bayesian, assigning probabilities to hypotheses becomes less weird. That is because Bayesians see probability as a measure of confidence in some statement/model/possible world.</p>
<p>As it’s name suggests, the Bayesian interpretation of probability is rooted in the Bayes theorem for conditional probabilities:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(A/B)=%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bp(A)%20%5Ccdot%20p(B/A)%7D%7Bp(B)%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Confidence in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> given the occurrence of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> is proportional to the product of the prior confidence in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and the conditional probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> - also called the <strong>Likelihood</strong> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">.</p>

<p>Bayes’ theorem is <strong>not</strong> a matter of interpretation. it can be derived from the basic probability axioms. It is linked with the interpretation of probability as a measure of confidence in statements because it defines the procedure of belief updating.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Re-phrasing the theorem, it is possible to formulate the posterior probability of a hypothesis given some observed data:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(hypothesis/data)=%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bp(hypothesis)%20%5Ccdot%20p(data/hypothesis)%7D%7Bp(data)%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Another possibility of conceptualize the Bayes mindset is seeing the posterior probability of the hypothesis as an <em>update</em> to the prior probability of it.</p>
<p>Bayes theorem also enable the comparison of two hypotheses using the ratio between the posteriors:/ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7Bp(hypothesis%20%5C,%201/data)%7D%7Bp(hypothesis%20%5C,%202/data)%7D=%20%5Cfrac%20%7B%5Cfrac%20%7Bp(hypothesis%20%5C,%201)%20%5Ccdot%20p(data/hypothesis%20%5C,%201)%7D%7Bp(data)%7D%7D%7B%5Cfrac%20%7Bp(hypothesis%20%5C,%202)%20%5Ccdot%20p(data/hypothesis%20%5C,%202)%7D%7Bp(data)%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Cancelling the annoying denominator yields the following: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%20%7Bp(hypothesis%20%5C,%201)%20%5Ccdot%20p(data/hypothesis%20%5C,%201)%7D%7Bp(hypothesis%20%5C,%202)%20%5Ccdot%20p(data/hypothesis%20%5C,%202)%7D%0A"></p>
<p>The ratio of posterior probabilities equals to the product of the prior ratio and the likelihood ratio. When this value is bigger then 1, it can considered as evidence in favor of Hypothesis 1.</p>

<section id="posterior-probability-of-hypotheses-given-p-values" class="level1">
<h1>Posterior probability of hypotheses given p-values</h1>
<p>Using Bayes theorem, it is now possible to construct a posterior probability for each of the original hypotheses, given an observed p-value.</p>
<section id="likelihood" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="likelihood">Likelihood</h2>
<p>What is the probability of p-values given each hypothesis? we actually answered this question earlier when we visualized the density distributions of p-values.</p>
<p>For example, the probability of observing a p-value between 0.03 and 0.04 given the null hypothesis is:</p>

<h1>So, what is the answer???</h1>
<p>What is the solution to this paradox? who is right? is statistical hypothesis testing is broken?</p>
<p>The source of the current disagreement is the interpretation of probability. Frequentists insist that hypotheses are True or False. There is no place for degrees of confidence in statements. Bayesians assign probability to hypotheses and statements themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you find yourself in the first camp, or in the second camp, remember:</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This post will be dedicated yet again to some experimentation with text analysis. I will be using mostly basic and classic NLP tools like word counting and DFM’s (Document-Feature matrix). I hope that in the next NLP post I will be using some more advanced methods like transformers (go BERT!).</p>
<p>I will be using the popular <em>Netflix</em> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows">dataset</a> from Kaggle. It contains data of movies and TV shows added to Netflix’s streaming service since 2008.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a relatively short post, the first part will include some nice visualization (word clouds), and in the second part I will try and build a mini show-recommendation function.</p>

<h1>Content trends in Netflix’s new additions</h1>
<p>Although it is pretty basic, the DFM allows us to check many things. For example: Did Netflix’s new content changed over the years? I thought it would be interesting to see the most frequent words in the descriptions of items added in each year.</p>
<p>As you can see, I have added a relative frequency column to the data. This is to control for the different number of items added in each year.</p>

<h1>Recommendation generator</h1>
<p>The Algorithm. Everyone online for the past 10 years are talking about the algorithm. ‘The algorithm’ is the method every app or website uses to predict our taste in videos/products/TV shows/twitts or Facebook posts.</p>
<p>In this part I try to create my own mini ‘algorithm’, But first, a short explanation on vector representation and similarity between texts.</p>
<section id="tf-idf-term-frequency---inverse-document-frequency" class="level2">

<section id="tf---term-frequency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tf---term-frequency">TF - Term Frequency</h3>
<p>Up until now I have used the most basic DFM - the count DFM. It basically counts the number of times each word appear in the document, and is sometimes also called ‘Bag of Words’.<br>
One problem that arises in our inner statistician is that longer documents contain more words! therefore, different term frequencies can be hard to compare. The simple solution is to calculate <em>Proportional frequency</em> in the following way:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aterm%20%5C%20frequency=%20%5Cfrac%7BN%20%5C%20times%20%5C%20a%20%5C%20word%20%5C%20appear%20%5C%20in%20%5C%20the%20%5C%20document%7D%7BTotal%20%5C%20number%20%5C%20of%20%5C%20words%20%5C%20in%20%5C%20the%20%5C%20document%7D%0A"></p>
<p>This gives us the <strong>Term frequency</strong> part of the tf-idf method.</p>
</section>
<section id="inverse-document-frequency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inverse-document-frequency">Inverse Document Frequency</h3>
<p>So we have the term frequency of every token (word). We can start and make show recommendations, right? Another problem that still exist is that some words could be prevalent in <strong>every</strong> document. For example, if the word ‘Life’ appears in a large number of descriptions, it is not so useful in identifying someones taste in TV shows and movies. If, on the other hand, the word ‘Father’ appear only in a small number of descriptions, it will be a lot more helpful to us. Therefore, we want to represent term <em>Uniqueness</em>. How can we do that?</p>
<p>For each token (word) the Inverse-Document-Frequency is calculated:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aidf=log(%20%5Cfrac%7BTotal%20%5C%20number%20%5C%20of%20%5C%20documents%7D%7BN%20%5C%20documents%20%5C%20containing%20%5C%20the%20%5C%20term%7D)%0A"></p>
<p>This number is getting close to zero the more documents containing the word, and is getting larger the less documents contain it (and the more documents we have).</p>
<p>To get the final tf-idf value for every term, we simply multiply the Term-Frequency with the Inverse-Document-Frequency:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Atfidf(word)=tf(word)%20%5Ccdot%20idf(word)%0A"></p>
<p>In creating the tf-idf DFM, I have also converted every word to lower case and to it’s stem.</p>

<p>Naturally these vector are mostly zeros…</p>
<p>But now that we have vectors we can do all the cool things that we can do with vectors! For example, we can recommend TV shows and movies based on how their vector representations are <em>similar</em> to a previously watched show. But how to calculate the similarity of two vectors?</p>
<p>If we return to Physics class, we can think of vectors as arrows with length and direction.</p>

<figcaption>Two vectors</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It is natural to think of the similarity between two vectors as the degree to which they point in the same direction. In other words, the angle between two vectors. It is possible to calculate the <em>cosine</em> between two vectors the following way:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Acos%20%5Ctheta=%20%5Cfrac%7B%20%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7Bb%7D%7D%7B%7C%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%7C%20%5Ccdot%20%7C%5Cvec%7Bb%7D%7C%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Without turning this into a real Physics class, in the numerator is the dot-product of the vectors, and in the denominator is the product of lengths of the vectors. For example, the cosine between the vectors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Ba%7D=(1,1)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Bb%7D=(-4,3)"> is:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Acos%20%5Ctheta=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%20%5Ccdot%20(-4)+1%20%5Ccdot%20(3)%7D%7B%20%5Csqrt%7B1%5E2+1%5E2%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Csqrt%7B(-4)%5E2+3%5E2%7D%7D=%5Cfrac%7B-1%7D%7B5%20%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>But what is the angle between ~15,000 dimensions vectors?! fortunately, this calculation remains the same in any dimension.</p>
<p>What is the relation between the angle and it’s cosine? without digging too deep, the larger the angle, the smaller the cosine. So the larger the cosine, the greater the similarity.</p>

<p>Nice insight: the cosine similarity is nothing but the un-standardized pearson correlation coefficient! Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> be vectors of Z scores. The correlation coefficient is:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar_%7Bxy%7D=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7BN%7D%7Bx_i%20%5Ccdot%20y_i%7D%7D%7BN%7D%0A"> While the cosine of the angle between them is:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Acos%20%5Ctheta=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7By%7D%7D%7B%7C%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%7C%20%5Ccdot%20%7C%5Cvec%7By%7D%7C%7D%0A"> The length of a vector of Z scores is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7BN%7D">, therefore the denominator is always: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Csqrt%7BN%7D=N">.<br>
The nominator is the dot product of the vectors, which is exactly the sum of the by-component products. Finally we get:<br>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This post is an extra step for me in the NLP domain. As always I try to explain the theory behind the interesting parts of the process. For example, I remember when I discovered the connection between the correlation coefficient and the angle between vectors, it was really eye opening!<br>
</p>
<p>The recommendation functions could be vastly improved with some more modern NLP methods (Transformers!). I hope that in the near future I will have the time to post about that to.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As part of my data-science courses this fall semester, I have started also to get into <em>Natural Language Processing</em> (NLP, but of the good kind). This is the first time I have ever tried it, so let’s see how it went.</p>
<p>Brief overview of the post:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Basic preprocessing and creation of <em>Data Feature Matrix</em> (DFM), using packages <code>stringr</code> and <code>quanteda</code>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Classification with Naive-Bayes method.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Classification with Logistic regression, and feature importance plot.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This dataset is the “Fake News football” dataset from uploaded to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawkyelgendy/fake-news-football">Kaggle</a> by Shawky El-Gendy. It contains ~42,000 tweets about the Egyptian football league, some of them are fake new, and some are true.</p>
<p>The work in this notebook is highly influenced by <span class="citation" data-cites="welbers2017">(Welbers, Van Atteveldt, and Benoit 2017)</span>.</p>

<p>Creating a count-based DFM (frequency of each word in each document). Before creating the DFM I employ 3 steps of normalization:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Removing special characters and expressions (punctuation, urls…).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Converting words to their stem-form (the word <em>example</em> converts to <em>exampl</em>). This step should decrease &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of unique tokens, so that our DFM would be less sparse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Converting every character to lower-case letters.</p>

<section id="naive-bayes-classifier" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-bayes-classifier">Naive-Bayes classifier</h2>
<p>A Naive-Bayes classifier predicts the class (in this case of a document) in the following way:<br>
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The likelihood of each token to appear in documents of each class is calculated from the training data. For example, if the word <em>manager</em> appeared in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?11">% of the documents in the first class, and in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2">% of the documents in the second class, the likelihood of it in each class is:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cdisplaylines%7Bp(manager%5C%20%7C%5C%20class%5C%201)=0.11%5C%5Cp(manager%5C%20%7C%5C%20class%5C%202)=0.02%7D%0A"></p></li>
<li><p>The prior probability of each document to be classified to each class is also learned from the training data, and it is the base-rate frequencies of the two classes.<br>
</p></li>
<li><p>For each document in the test set, the likelihood of it given it is from each of the classes is calculated by multiplying the likelihoods of the tokens appearing in it. So if a document is for example the sentence <em>I like turtles</em>, then the likelihood of it to belong class 1 is:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cdisplaylines%7Bp(I%5C%20%7C%5C%20class%5C%201)%5Ccdotp(like%5C%20%7C%5C%20class%5C%201)%5Ccdotp(turtles%5C%20%7C%5C%20class%5C%201)%7D%0A"><br>
More formally, if a document belong to a certain class <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">, then it’s likelihood of being comprised of a set of tokens <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cprod_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bn%7Dp(t_i%5C%20%7C%5C%20class%5C%20k)%0A"></p></li>
<li><p>According to Bayes theorem, the probability of the document to belong to class <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> - the posterior probability - is proportional to the product of the likelihood of it’s tokens given this class and the prior probability of any document to belong to this class:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(class%5C%20k%5C%20%7C%5C%20t)%20%5Cpropto%20p(t%5C%20%7C%5C%20class%5C%20k)%5Ccdotp(class%5C%20k)%0A"></p></li>
<li><p>Because the Naive-Bayes classifier is comparing between classes, the standardizing term is not needed. The class that has the largest product of prior and likelihood is the class the document will be classified to.</p></li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I think that for a first attempt at implementing NLP, the current notebook came out nice. I have learned a lot not only about NLP, but also on Naive-Bayes classifiers which is nice.</p>

<h1>Background and analysis plan</h1>
<p>The current <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/babatundezenith/fifa-archive">Data</a> is an upload to <em>Kaggle</em> by Babatunde Zenith, and it includes information about players in the popular <em>FIFA 23</em> video game. Information includes: name, age, nationality, position, various football ratings and contract deals.</p>
<p>The current notebook is an attempt at:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Accurately and efficiently predicting player’s overall rating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Identifying important variables (features) for this prediction.</p>
<p>Both goals will be achieved using two methods: Elastic-net regression and Decision tree Boosting. Data pre-processing will be done with <code>tidyverse</code>, Model fitting and evaluation will be done with the <code>caret</code> and <code>gbm</code> packages.</p>

<p>Player value is the strongest predictor by far, with a few interesting ones right behind it (CB_rating?).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Both methods supplied outstanding results with over 94% and 99% explained variance in rating. Not so surprisingly Player’s value is strongly linked with their overall FIFA rating. A few notable findings are the importance of <em>Reactions</em>, <em>CB_rating</em> and <em>Defending_total</em>. Overall, Defensive ability seems to be quite an important predictor of Player’s rating.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>As I told in another post, I’ve recently enrolled to a course about Data-Viz (and maybe some NLP later-on, stay tuned). One of the assignments in the course was to make some <code>TidyTuesday</code> contribution and present it in class. Although this is not what I’ve presented in class, this was made shortly after and I think it came out quite nice :)</p>

<section id="the-data" class="level1">
<h1>The Data</h1>
<section id="from-the-github-repo" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-github-repo">From the Github <a href="https://github.com/tomerzipori/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-25">repo</a>:</h5>
<p><em>This data includes &gt;80,000 recorded UFO “sightings” around the world, including the UFO shape,</em> <em>lat/long and state/country of where the sighting occurred, duration of the “event” and the</em> <em>data_time when it occurred.</em></p>
<p><em>Data comes originally from <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/">NUFORC</a>, was cleaned and uploaded to Github by <a href="https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports">Sigmond Axel</a>, and some exploratory plots were created by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbouchet/e-t-phone-home-but-mostly-after-8-00pm">Jonathan Bouchet</a> a few years back.</em></p>

<p>After some experimenting I’ve decided to make a heat map to visualize the number of UFO reports per state. But first, some more data processing. I first counted the number of cases per state (<em>by_state</em>), and then combined it with the USA map data frame (<em>by_state2</em>).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Washington is spooky! I really don’t know why Washington is leading in this measure. Like most people I’ve expected to find Nevada or Utah (which is last!) in the first place. Having said that, UFO stands for “<strong>Unidentified</strong> foreign object”, maybe the people of Nevada know what they are seeing in the sky lol.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Some time ago, when the fall semester began I’ve enrolled on a course called <em>Data science lab</em> as part of the ‘Data Science for the Social Sciences’ program. One of the assignments was to make some <code>TidyTuesday</code> contribution and present it in class. So this is my submission and what I consider as my first respectable attempts at visualizing data.</p>

<p><em>The data this week comes from <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/E008R01-us-egg-production-data">The Humane League’s US Egg Production* *dataset</a> by <a href="https://samaramendez.github.io/">Samara Mendez</a>. Dataset and code is available for this project on OSF at <a href="https://osf.io/z2gxn/">US Egg Production Data Set</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>This dataset tracks the supply of cage-free eggs in the United States from December 2007 to February 2021. For TidyTuesday we’ve used data through February 2021, but the full dataset, with data through the present, is available in the <a href="https://osf.io/z2gxn/">OSF project</a>.</em></p>

<p>Few hours deep, I’ve decided it would be interesting to see the change in number of cage-free hens compared to caged hens during the time period we have data about. Because I wanted to plot only certain points of data along the time axis, I needed to create a subset of the big data-frame that holds the data for the points I wanted to plot.</p>

<p>First thing, I found 6 dates that are equally spaced between the start and end points. The repetitive code below is quite ugly, and <code>lubridate</code> probably has a nice and elegant solution, I didn’t want to spend to much time on it.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There is a steady and relative fast growth in cage-free hens in the US, compared with caged-housed hens. Nice. As I said in the beginning. this is my first <code>TidyTuesday</code> contribution, and the first data visualization attempts that I felt worthy of posting lol. I learned a few tricks along the way for example:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> lubridate’s <em>date</em> format is super nice to work with. It can be seq’t along and do all kind of efficient things for dealing with timely data.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Referencing more then one data-frame in a single <code>ggplot()</code>, Seems obvious, but I didn’t think about this solution to plotting just some of the data until this mini-project.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> Many-many things about aesthetics of <code>ggplot2</code>, like the <code>annotate()</code> and <code>labs()</code> functions and arguments.</p>
